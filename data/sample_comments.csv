0	calxllum				"I think that's a bug, personally from a lot of campaign and a bit of custom battles night runners don't feel like a replacement for slingers.

Slingers feel far more useful for harassing units around your army and getting in that morale damage.(Some Skaven clan rats and a unit of slingers can make Kroxigores route with a good surround and focus fire, especially with a spell in the middle of them or sniping the lord.)

While Nightrunners are better at dedicated skirmishers, harass arches with them, force the enemy to draw units away and pepper them, and once they're out of ammo just use them to flank for your clan rats and break units.

I haven't really tried out the more expensive variants of the night runners, but I imagine they play the same but just a bit more annoying.

So, vs AI you can break up their army and possibly even pull half of it away with just a few nightrunners while constantly plinking at their health. Vs players they seem like an annoyance and way to distract/take away some of their micro or punish them if they're not paying attention."

You'd get Mind Controller to onyx(!) by the end if you kept up that pace fielding for 19 hours, and if you do it in the right spot (or just put in one last field at the end) you could pretty easily get Illuminator too. You'd *just* get Connector platinum by the end of it, and could get Recruiter platinum with virtually no effort on your part if it's prepped in advance.

The 3 extra golds is where things start to break down a bit. Spec Ops is pretty easy, but you'd need to have a lot of easy 4 portal missions in the same area to do it and still have time for your last two. Translator gold is doable in that timeframe, but would take up a majority of that time and leave you one gold short. I expect Spec Ops/Pioneer/Explorer would be the best combo, since doing Pioneer would inherently get you half-way to Explorer. It's plausible that Spec Ops/Pioneer/Recharger might be faster with some good key management, but with how temperamental Niantic is for recharging I'd rather just go for the thousand additional unique hacks.

Also nice as you can choose if you want aggro up or down in combat. She is also pretty easy to use, as you basically just use her #3 turn 1 and if you dont need to never touch her again, which is very nice to attack mashing.

It's obvious that countries, that have such a low GDPs/capita aren't sensitive towards social issues, because they're not even first world countries, but emerging countries. Also the cultural difference is more severe, not only because of the culture itself, but the fact that those countries had until the 90s totalitarian governments, therefore they have experience with democracy (including minority rights) not even for 30 years now.

0	Quis_Custodiet		UnitedKingdom paramedic	UK - Paramedic	Paediatric intubation is *much* harder because of their differing anatomy, the risk for barotrauma is higher in kids, their soft tissues are more easily traumatised and they're easier to manage with less invasive methods anyway. Unless you need the tube because it's an asthmatic arrest, or because of developing airway oedema, ETT should be a very low priority in children. I would argue that paramedics should almost never really be considering paediatric intubation if other methods are available, and never electively outside of airway oedema.

- I have a very young team, I am also not competitive this year. (Almost guaranteed to start 0-4 after my opponents Rodgers/Nelson stack on Thursday).

- **Trade:** Travis Kelce, Rawls, 2019 2nd (not mine, probably a mid) 

- **Receive:** OJ Howard, David Njoku, 2018 First (Likely mid).

&amp;nbsp;

- Rawls is just being throw in since I would drop him anyway. It's either him or Clement and I'm probably dropping Clement for Marlon Mack.

- My TE's after this trade would be: Njoku, Jonnu Smith, and OJ Howard

- It would also be my **fifth** 2018 first round pick. (Mine which will be 1.01 or 1.02 at the worst, two probable mids, and two probable late).

&amp;nbsp;

- I realize Kelce is a great asset. I do have Mahomes, which would make for a great stack in the future. But Kelce will probably be at the end of his prime by the time I am truly competitive. Kelce is my second oldest player. (Luck is my oldest). Kelce has also only had 1 elite year as a TE in fantasy. 2014/2015 were decent, but nothing like last year.

5 however, from the getgo, is action packed and horror lite. Crowds of enemies in broad daylight in the  African heat, followed by silly tentacle bosses like Excella or dragon sea monsters like Irving, huge minigun fights on a boat, plus other things. A co-op partner in the form of Sheva also helps eliminate any pure traces of survival horror.

0	Cramerflave				This was sparked out of conversation with a friend about the current mindset of the average American. The general distrust of our government, growing inequality(including the rise of AI and the inevitable massive loss of jobs), mass surveillance and consistent nuclear threat by delusional leaders being the main catalysts. And by media portrayal and tribe mentality among social media, these issues and the likelihood of revolution seem to be growing everyday.  It seems this form of corrupt government certainly has a limited life-span. It also seems relatively certain there lies a tipping point at which the majority of Americans will be so fed up with the failing system that unification to overthrow the gov is inevitable. Do you think it's likely, or even possible? Is it preventable or inevitable? What do you think this could look like? A lot of big, unanswerable questions here. Just curious what your thoughts are!

""I support a protest, but only when and how I say."" Just sack up and say you don't support it--it's not support if you dictate how it's done.  I'd still think it's stupid, but could respect the honesty at least.

That said, there's really nothing anyone can do since it sounds like the program is private.  Such programs can set whatever standards they like as long as they don't discriminate against a protected class. A public school would be a different story I think.

0	monsantobreath				"&gt; This makes no logical, rhetorical, or grammatical sense

Yes it does, because when you say the reasoning behind the action is fair but the action as taken is not you're defending the intent to take action, not the specific action itself. In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.

&gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape

On some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said ""so and so got raped by her ex"" and someone replied ""well she did screw him over hard in the divorce"". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.

When people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.

&gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions

I already acknowledged that. I said that doesn't matter and I have explained why. Your prejudice against Islam allows you to justify however thinking in these grotesque terms and think you're clean in doing so."

0	[deleted]				"It depends on whether the toll collection authority has a reciprocal agreement with the state/province.

I have used British Columbia plates in Washington and California, and successfully evaded the tolls because while my license plate was scanned, no agreement was in place to actually track me down and bill me. Same for using California plates in Ontario, Canada.

Toll collection authorities will only track down out-of-state plates that they expect to show up frequently. For example, New York is often visited by drivers from Ontario and Massachusetts, so if you're from those places and try to use NY tolled roads without an EZPass you will get nailed. Likewise, Ontario will track drivers from Quebec, Michigan, and NY for sure. But if your car is registered in California, then it's highly unlikely that they'll bother to track you down. It costs them money to do so, and California-plated cars are a rare sight in that region."

0	BrungardtBlade-Tool				"As for the name? I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.

I love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.

I understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10"" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.

If my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5"" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.

If you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.

Here's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.

Quick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly."

but as for it being part of necrontyr tech.

&gt;Kotov sighed and nodded as if Roboute had passed some kind of test.‘Very well, Mister Surcouf, I believe you may be correct. Perhaps some aspect of necrontyr technology does lie at the heart of the Breath of the Gods, and if that is the case, then it is doubly imperative we prevent Telok from leaving this world.’
‘Why?’ said Anders, ‘I mean, besides the obvious?’
‘Because if there is any truth to the old legends, then it is entirely possible that a vast shard of one of the ancient necrontyr gods lies entombed within the Noctis Labyrinthus.’
And suddenly it all made a twisted kind of sense to Roboute. He turned to Bielanna, who appeared to be studiously ignoring their conversation.
‘You knew, didn’t you?’ he said. ‘You said as much back in the cavern. What did you call it? “The infernal engine of the Yngir?” I’m going to assume that’s your word for the necrontyr gods.’
Bielanna nodded slowly.

Also, if he didn't know before, his status as a Yonko, acquisition of a large crew and islands should've provided the opportunity for him to have discovered that at some point.

&gt;and his whole crew gang up on her its likely he'll take her down

If Blackbeard still needs his entire crew to take down one weakened Yonko, he's weak, and I hope that isn't the case."	True	0	1506816012		0	0	dnqikbp	False	t3_73gtdq	t3_73gtdq	/r/OnePiece/comments/73gtdq/manga_spoilers_theory_bm_defeat/dnqikbp/	1509189611	1	False	OnePiece	t5_2rfz5

That's a made up number and didn't really portray the changes though. You're making an assumption that the total unique viewers are double for half the time. While it's true that total unique viewers might increase, there is nothing to support the idea that it'd double. On the other hand, it is already proven that the total number games (time) will be less than half of the previous year."

0	flyingwolf				"&gt;Elaborate, please. Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.

You stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system. 

If you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts. 

&gt;I’ve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people’s mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.

I made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was ""figurative"". 

Say what you mean and you won't have all of these ""internet warriors"" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them. 

&gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.

OK.

You said. 

&gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.


Then you stated what that meant was:

&gt; I didn’t mean, “leave right now and never look back”. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.


To which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time. 

So first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right. 

As an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is ""premises"", not ""premise"".

0	quantumgambit				I like to think of it like scotch on the rocks. At the beginning, at its freshest, the flavors are bold and really pop, things are exciting and a great opener for the adventure your about to experience. As you get farther along and things soften and mellow, you notice the softer notes as they are allowed to come to prominence. And at the very end you are gently let back down as you throw back that last little cusp of flavor and the experience fades. All great breakfast cereal, like scotch, is a journey.

0	AlanYx			"iPad Pro 10.5"" 4G"	"I'm super picky about screens, and I don't think it really matters. There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.

If you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.

Incidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not ""bad"". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)

Two good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed: 

* There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.

* The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.

There is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.

I wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017. I think it's one of the best deals Apple has ever offered."	True	0	1506816015		1506816205	0	dnqikes	False	t3_73ffs0	t3_73ffs0	/r/ipad/comments/73ffs0/how_important_is_the_non_laminated_display_on_tge/dnqikes/	1509189612	3	False	ipad	t5_2rgny

0	CummyBot2000			Reposts copypasta for mobile users	"I, too, was at Ribfest. A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white ""Where's the beef?"" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says ""Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long"" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says ""oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs"", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy ""Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!"" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks ""What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?"" The man smiles and says ""Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead."" And one of the people in line says ""I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that"". Others joined in ""Me too!"" ""I'll pay double!"" ""Triple!"" ""Money is no object!"" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, ""Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?"" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies ""Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right"" Someone else shouts ""And vanilla extract!"" And the puzzled guy says ""Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?"" White shirt: ""Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?"" Puzzled guy: ""Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway."" Then someone pipes up ""Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?"" ""Maybe they have a skillet?"" someone replied. 

After all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap. My hands were free because I couldn't eat the eggs - I'm gluten intolerant. u/manic_eye"	True	0	1506816015		0	0	dnqikf7	False	t3_73ig5q	t3_73ig5q	/r/copypasta/comments/73ig5q/ribfest/dnqikf7/	1509189614	1	False	copypasta	t5_2r6z7

0	MakeThePieBigger		Anarcho-Capitalist 	Autarchist	"&gt;No, you're playing word games. Either enslavement is the price of being saved, or the act of saving and the act of exploiting are separate. You can't have it both ways.

That's not how you've described the situation. If they offered him safety in exchange for becoming a slave, while he was floating through space, that would be a different issue. This would be the one case where the act of enslaving actually improves the situation.

&gt;Here you are not comparing exploitation with slavery, you are comparing selling with slavery. Selling someone an apple is not exploitation.

OK: You are starving and I sell you an apple for 100 000$. - I still improve your situation. 

&gt;Maintaining slavery requires constantly feeding, clothing and sheltering your slaves, so you are continuously improving their position. These acts are necessary to slavery, but slavery is not necessary to these acts.

Ah, but here's the rub! The only person who can judge the change in quality of the situation is the person themselves. If the upkeep produced an actual net improvement to the slave's situation, they would not need to be a slave - they would work voluntarily! The fact that a threat of violence is necessary to keep the slave working implies that maintaining slavery actually worsens their situation.

For slavery to be slavery (forced actions), a threat of force must be present. And this means that the slaver necessarily worsens the slave's situation to make them choose to work!"

0	LadyTherese				"A month into the school year and LO is settled in nicely to the routine! She's in a one year old room (she's 19 months) at the center that I work at.  Group size is small (3 teachers for a class of 6) and I love the her teachers. She's  helper at school but gets whiny if she's hungry and it's not snack time or lunch time yet.  So pretty reasonable! Everyone loves her.  Except for that one time that she covered herself in bird poop on the playground somehow.  I thought it was hilarious.

The worst part is having to pre-make food for her every single day.  Breakfast, AM Snack, Lunch, and PM Snack. So tiring! Luckily we're getting a routine down for that too.

Not School related- My husband bought me a piece of wood so that I can make a height ruler chart to have on the wall in our apartment.  I want to make it (as opposed to just using a door jamb) so that when we get a house of our own we can bring it with us!  I'm excited :)

0	TheBlackDred		userflair	anti-theist	"&gt;That doesn't logic right. There may be 1000 types of Christianity but none of them are related to whether Christianity is ""correct,"" again, whatever that means. 

Sure it does. If we take that Christianity is the correct religion ( instead of atheism or *insert a list of all other deistic ideology here*) then any given Christian has a 1 in 1000 shot at interpreting the dogma in the correct way as to not be a blasphemous hell bound sinner. 

&gt;What does it mean to be correct 

In this case it means that of all available options, both past and present, you successfully chose the one that ends up being true. 

&gt;and furthermore, what does a sect of Christianity not practicing Christianity correctly mean to whether Christianity is correct? 

Nothing. That's why I said that if we accept the **premise** that Christianity is correct, it still only gives any single practioner a one in 1000 shot at being right. It does not bear on wether or not Christians are right, that number was too astronomical to calculate.

0	PillShapedSobriety				"Maybe it has to do with the fact that being a reservist sucks shit these days.

I left a while ago, but comparing what we got to do, compared to what the militia got to do in the 1980's, it is why no wonder why no one wants to stay in anymore.

Guys I know that were in in the 80's talk about thousands of reservists being on exercises in the summer and thousands on exercise in the winter. M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.

Compared to now. 
Maybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say ""Bang Bang"" when ""shooting"". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.

That same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.


That and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.


Reservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun. Why would anyone earn very little money one night a week and do basically nothing with not much opportunity stay? The $1.25 beers in the mess only make up for doing your 3rd BFT of the month for so long.

As far as subject tests, that is a huge range of scores for the Math II you are getting. The Lit test is generally considered pretty hard, so even a 650 isn't that bad of a score. What books are you using for Math II? I could give you some tips on how I crammed the week before the test.

0	KangaLlama		quote dick	Right. In. The. Dick.	"LIS had me enjoying Chloe as a character but irritated in some respects. BTS has made her my favourite character and justified plenty for why she is the way she is in LIS. 


I'm looking forward and not looking forward to finding out how Rachel ends up with Frank. Chloe considers her a close connection and inevitably at some point, a lover, otherwise she wouldn't have flipped out when you find out the relationship of Rachel and Frank. 


Rachel's someone I think who enjoys playing with people to a degree and is almost certainly a liar, yet is the thing with Frank because of something that happens, or are the feelings genuine, and what possesses her to betray Chloe? Or was it all misinterpreted by Frank or mis-sold as something more serious than it really was. Hard to say. 
So many questions. Team Chloe all the way though. 


Hella looking forward to the next episode.

Thought I'd post this, as the post match thread here has been unusually controversial. Accusations of sub biases notwithstanding, Burki, Andrey, Papa, Bartra, Kagawa who were all praised here and in the match thread, get good to passing marks. Weigl, Pulisic, Dahoud, Toljan, Auba who drew criticism here all get sub par marks from the German press as well as German readers at large. Pretty sure it isn't ""American hipsters"" writing for German papers. Just saying.

IDK about that. I was skeptical about them but then a bunch of cucks got all huffy over the merger and left the Conservative parties and that made it all a lot more appealing in my eyes. Butt hurt cucks means there's a good chance of potential there. Of course nothing's certain in politics, there's always a chance of backstabbing kikery but I'm hopeful. I really liked Brian and Callaway and the other 2 would be ""ok"". A Kike'd up business neo-liberal is still 1000x better than the out right SJW Commies we have right now.

Late afternoon sun tends to be strong so shade lovers like ferns might not be the best bet. The upside of afternoon sun is that it will support a wide variety of colorful plants: annuals like fancy trailing geraniums and sun resistant coleus (Trailing Plum is pretty and dependable http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/57816/) in hanging baskets. In pots, you could grow dwarf zinnias, dwarf to mid-height snapdragons, petunias in a zillion colors and patterns, and sun resistant impatience like SunPatiens (http://www.costafarms.com/plants/impatiens-sunpatiens) for color.

Something I tried for the first time this year that was super cute and unusual was dwarf eucomis or pineapple lilies. They grow from spring-planted bulbs in half day sub and look great from June into fall. Very unusual and whimsical. I grew this variety and will again:  http://www.leafari.com/eucomis-aloha-nani-hybrid.html

My score deviation is actually -.5, so apparently I'm a slightly harsh rater compared to average.

Are you hearing clipping with the recorded signal?

It sounds like something is wrong with Audition if normalizing to -3 isn’t actually bringing the peak level to -3. Like the meters are maybe calibrated to a different scale than DBFS. Again, I’m not familiar, but I can’t imagine what scale it would be calibrated to in this case."

Only thing I could suggest is give the kizumonogatari movies a try. You're usually suppose to watch it after bakemonogatari but it's better than not watching at all. Kizu is more ""newcomer"" friendly than the rest of the series due to less narration and more action then usual.

That *is* the general consensus in Russia; post collapse the perhaps overzealous economic advise given by U.S. advisers was poor, and/or poorly understood, and/or poorly implemented, but mostly thought to be poor advise based on fundamentals that worked just fine in situation A, but not situation F(ucked) which is where Russia was. 

Actually most of the population thinks Gorbachev sold out and/or was bribed by the west. I could be wrong but I think he's less popular than Stalin. Thereabouts anyway.

0	ieattime20				"Prior to IP there were trade secrets that protected innovators from competition. Heck, many candy companies still have trade secrets today rather than patents. The idea isn't that IP protects competition, as competition would be fine without it. The issue is that IP provides other benefits besides rent seeking to innovators, advantages that aren't talked about.

Imagine modern medicine with trade secrets. There's no way for it to work. How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price. Patents means the mode of action of a medicine is out in the open so it can *immediately* begin benefiting future science.

Trade secrets are also, well, secrets. It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.

However IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects.

0	Scott_Steiner_BBBD				"I think a lot of people don't realize this about indigenous folks is that a lot of the councils are insanely corrupt.  Generally any money made on reserve usually stays among the council and their families.  I feel sorry for those people.  I used to live in North Western Ontario and man they got the short end of the stick from both the government and their own people who were supposed to be their ""leaders"".

Many weren't allowed to drink on the res so usually once a month when the cheques came in they'd drive to the nearest town that had an LCBO, Beer Store, and Walmart/major grocery store and just clear the places out.  Two things wouldn't be uncommon to see at the local hotels/motels in town at the end of the month A. Pick up trucks full of food/supplies/etc and drunk/passed out natives everywhere.  

Naturally they couldn't get TOO drunk (many of the young ones would) otherwise they ran the risk of someone nosey person who lived in town (in small towns everyone knew everyone even if they lived on the res) to call the council leaders and rat on some poor drunk native kid.  

Add to the fact that they would jack up the prices on all the food/supplies on the res because a lot of times the council leaders were in league with either the airline that would fly the stuff in or the companies that would truck the stuff in and get a cut of the profit from that.  

Overall they were just insanely corrupt and treated their own people like shit and then just told them it was the white man."

0	jimsauce719				"It's a couple of different things:

I could be mistaken here, but in the traditional fighting game sense:

1. Tech = ""Throw Tech'ing"" or breaking and/or escaping a throw.  You'll usually hear the word ""throw"" closely associated with the word tech to seperate it from the second definition:

2. Tech = short for ""Technology"" or a method, strategy, or technique for dealing with a particular situation.  It's slang and doesn't really mean anything specifically but you'll hear it used in a phrase such as:

""Did you see that new reality stone-Spiderman tech?!  You know, the 'tech' where he can keep looping the freeze into web ball over and over again into massive combo damage.""

Finally, I'm not a Smash/Melee player but I think ""tech"" means something slightly different there where it has more to do with ones ability to do certain (difficult) techniques on the pad.  Usually it follows closely with the second definition above, and contextually it usually make sense, but at times it could mean something slightly different.

0	mintgroenmeisje				"I wear hijab but I know the struggle. It was very difficult for me to take the step. 

It wasn't that I thought hijab is oppressive and backwards. 
It wasn't that I denied that it's an obligation in Islam. 
It wasn't that I wanted to dress in a way that would arouse men. 
It wasn't that I didn't pray and had practically no personal relationship with Allah. 
It wasn't that I had big sins I wasn't ready to let go of yet and felt it would be hypocritical to wear hijab. 
It wasn't that I had no knowledge of Islam. 
It was simply that I was afraid...

Afraid of people's reactions, afraid of being treated differently (I know how they think about Islam and Muslims), afraid of having less chances etc. I *hated* myself for apparently fearing people more than Allah, but it was just extremely difficult for me. I can't really explain how hard it was. It was a form of social anxiety/phobia and it took me years to finally be able to take the step. The tears I dropped in those years could probably fill a pool. The struggle was real, that's all I'm saying. But people don't see that. They just see your public sin and judge you based on that.

This was *my* personal struggle with hijab, but other girls can have different issues with hijab. Or they do wear hijab but have different struggles. Everybody sins, but they sin differently. I know a lot of people struggle with praying on time, porn addiction, masturbation, boyfriends/girlfriends, gambling, drinking, whatever. Some feel guilty about it and others don't. The only consistent thing is that everybody has their own struggles and we don't know who's more beloved by Allah."

Consider this code:

            low = values[mid] + 1;

If low=0 and high=4 (because there are 5 items in the array), this will set low equal to 1 + whatever **value** is in the middle of the array.  It could be 655, if the input was {0, 11, 655, 765, 888}.  You don't want low=656, you want low=3.

See the difference?

That mistake is in both your recalculation of low and of high. 

And then: once you reset either low or high, you can recalc mid based on these new values.  mid=(low+high)/2 no matter what, right?

0	teddybur9				"Right now you should catch up with the 7 deadly dragons. Get Key of ""insert dragon name here"" from each dragon and finish all story quest in /battleundere. Then do the first quest from a glowing LED dragon and pick up the drop. They would later release items for those who possess the 7 keys and the quest drop. 

If you're looking to farm xp and gold, /battleground is the best place. 

For weapons, get the doomblade of destruction. It's worth getting it considering the dmg and xp, rep, and gold boost it gives you. Probably the only weapon in game with these boosts combined in one weapon.

If you haven't been on for 4-5 years, then I assume you missed finishing 13 lord of chaos. It's an interesting storyline so I would recommend completing it.

Other than that, aqw is packed with adventures and new items, so keep in track with the news, and patch notes. Also use your map to keep track of the storyline. It would help big time. Hope this helps.

I kinda like being able to see my surroundings without really having to move my eyes too much (or at all), and am very used to the SQM size of this particular size. I also enjoy having a bigger chat, but that's just a nice bonus, I mainly do it for the screen's size. Too used to it by now, I guess!

What do you want him to do, just magically make all of Puerto Ricos problems disappear? Sorry people but this is the real world where you can't sleep in your Minecraft bed to speed up the time. Theres only so much he can do, the rest is on the Puerto Ricans to actually rebuild themselves. Just look at all of his tweets about Puerto Rico from the past 24 hours. Does it seem like he doesn't care? Count the number of his Puerto Rico related tweets in the past week. I mean honestly it's like CNN and the rest of them are living in a parallel universe. He's going there on Tuesday. I don't have a problem with a human taking a golf break, especially after all the work he does. Come on people, it's a Saturday, he spent the entire week mucking through the tax code for US, The American people. Let him golf for an hour.

0	El_Nombre_Occupado		sheet4pos4	I bless the Reigns down in Africa	"I think 50 percent of the roster could be as “great” as Roman if they got the same amount of time and work put into them. Most wrestlers on the roster don’t get 25 minutes in a main event to do whatever they want too. I’m not going to credit others, it takes two to make a match, but he is put in positions that could be so much more watchable if he wasn’t just so god damn boring.

As for him being better than Cena, some people have short memories. I’ve never seen Roman have matches as good as Cena Vs Michaels, Cena Vs Rollins, he’s never done anything near most of the Cena Vs Punk matches, his three way with Rollins and Lesnar was better than the exact same match but with Reigns.

0	jstolfi		btcmanapot	Jorge Stolfi - Professor of Computer Science	"The problem is that the EDA only starts to act after the block rate got very low for 12 hours, then it gives a fast block rate for a while, then the normal DDA kicks in, shoos the miners away, and brings the block rate to snail pace again -- over and over.

0	Cheeefang				"Haha thanks!Very honoured to have so many questions ahahahaha.

NEVER SOLOQ.The people there are stupid and will waste your time.They don't even know the meta right now which is full of mages,and they keep insisting on playing mm which is just stupid.

Many high elo players play in their teams (say 5 man)but personally I don't.In fact I don't really play with my squad but with other friends from other squads.But in my squad there is a whatsapp group and you can just ask for someone and then play tgt haha.

I don't plan I just play when I feel like playing.

I got it one day before the season ended.Personally i don't recommend gaming so much to 600 because the only good thing u get out of it is ""bragging rights""/""self-fulfilment""but to be honest ..
-Nobody really cares how many stars u have 
-You will never feel happy because there will always be someone higher than you.

I had to spend ALOT of time(luckily it was holidays).I only played hard in the last month of the season.I climbed from 200 to 600 in one month lol.


Advice ermmm....Don't feel nervous if you meet Top squads.Because they are human and they make mistakes in game and can lose sometimes.They have high stars but stars aren't really a good indicator of skill.ive seen 200 star legends beat a 5 man team all above 1k stars so yeah.

Try to go for a trio q with your friends.One of the 3 people must play critical roles in the team like mages or assasin in case pubs can't carry.(most of the time they can't).If you get first pick,do choose what's currently in the meta.When I played trio there was a time I won 30 straight rank games in a row so yea.

Duo is a little more risky in my opinion as there will be 3 heavy people that u have to carry.

5 man is hard since there are a lot of pros who are playing in 5 man teams so personally I stay away from it.But it can be great if your squad has a lot of experience together.

Always try to improve and ask yourself what you could have don't better whenever you die.Maybe your Friend typed ""enemy missing in action""and you thought meh they may be farming but then u get ganked.

This is a little weird but personally i feel if you play in the wee hours of the morning,that is the most optimal time to raise stars because there are many noobs at that time.It sounds funny but without it I wouldn't be at 600 LOL.

And lastl but not least,don't be addicted to the game.I see many of my friends above 400 stars who play overnight until 7am and then have to go to work.You should know your priorities and not waste your life for a number that means shit.

In the next season I will retire as I feel that I'm too addicted and I have better things to focus on.Aft getting 600 stars I'm abit sick of ranked games haha.
I won't go for it because there are a lot of things to sacrifice to gain it so yea

Happy to ans your qns:)

I got counseling and medication (which I also hated) and struggled through. I got a job that I hated, played with my medications to make it through the day and tried to be a good person.

And one day I was done. I didn't want to drug myself to get through life, to even get through a day. Life was more than that. So I quit my job and stopped taking my meds. Found something else I preferred to do and never looked back.

Are you happy with your program that you are in? Are you happy with where you live and the direction your life is heading? Think hard about that. Especially if you can't even study on the weekends. I recall only doing that on weekends because I was so exhausted during the week.

Weekends are supposed to rejuvenate you. Be a time to relax and catch up on 'you time'. Maybe you aren't loving yourself enough?

I still suggest that you get up, shower, and get dressed on the weekends. Perhaps at least go for a walk to get out of the house. And definitely keep your therapy appointment. It always helps to talk to someone else.

0	aceafours				I can attest that this deck is quite good at achieving total lock, but I still have two big grievances with it. First is that without White it can have a hard time making up large point differences in a timed environment. Second is that, as the deck is presented here, there isn't any forced movement from the Purple cards. I know the deck is straining to include all the answers it needs, but without movement effects a Villain farm looks at this deck, shrugs its shoulders, and does what it was going to do anyway (with the one exception of Aloe &amp; Lotus).

0	JimSta		34Gold WW	Hali	"I definitely wouldn't say I hate him  but this makes me think of his hollywoodreporter profile. In the part where his castmates describe him, Patrick said he thought Ryan was famous because production was always talking to him more than everyone else. And he was featured prominently in a lot of the promotion for the season.

So I think it's more of a backlash because people feel like he's transparently being fed to them as the face of the season. And maybe there's an impression that he's aware of his archetype and he's playing it up to get screen time and become a big character.

0	1st_Gen_Charizard			6969 Entertainment Specialist	"Well everything is entirely dependent on your situation. I just got done reading through this thread and a 3.9 GPA is extremely strong for a community college. Most CC's(Community College's) will have you take a placement tests and that will determine which class levels to take. In an ideal world you would have a good chunk of change saved up for life after the corps and use that to pay for CC Courses and you would crash at your parents place. Once your done with your Core Classes and begin your transfer to a University and start using your GI bill. If you apply for FAFSA you can also opt to do a work study which gives you a chance to work &lt;20 hours per week at the University as a side job. Being a MCWIS you should be able to land a life guard job no problem. 


Paying for Community College with the GI Bill can seem like a waste if you can pay for it out of pocket. But if you dont have a choice then it can be a lifesaver.

Not to get too personal but the more info you give about your situation the better we can help you out brother.

If they say yes, then you could talk to the IG or legal, I have no idea whom, but there should be a way around it.

0	xSQUALLx				"So yeah. Late last year I was travelling through Japan with some friends of mine (I tend to goto Japan for a few weeks every year) 

On this occasion I met this lovely 38 year old woman named Hiroko at a cocktail bar in Kyoto. I noticed her looking my way a few times but I couldn't tell if it was good or bad because, well I'm a bigger guy and in Japan it's already a big disadvantage lol 

With the power of a little liquid courage I managed to walk past her as I went to the to the bar and as I walked back I managed to make a little joke about the drink she had (wish I did in English, that could've been a waste of time lol) thankfully she saw the humor to it and asked where I am from 

So we sat and spoke for a bit, found out she actually visited my city with her now ex husband a few years ago. So we already had some common ground. In the middle of chatting causally we were making cheeky jabs at each other too so I could tell there was something there. Her girlfriends arrived and so we exchanged Line IDs and went our seperate ways.

Now I didnt think this would go anywhere, because I was going to Osaka the next day. But we spoke for a couple days on Line before she asked me straight up if I wanted to spend some time with her on the weekend. Of course I jumped at the opportunity and booked us an Airbnb.

She caught the train in from Kyoto and she was wearing this cute little outfit that and a little bow tie lol but she made it look cute. We headed back the Airbnb where wow it had an incredible view of Osaka Castle. 

We sat down on the couch to rest our feet and she didnt waste much time. She told me she was excited because she had never been with a ""western man"" before (whether thats true or not, i dont give a shit) and went straight to unzipping my pants and reaching into grab my cock. With a smile on her face she looked and me and said ""very big"" (now for record, she's clear fan servicing. Im not overly big in that area at all. Probably just abit over average in length, pretty girthy though)

She told me stand up and when i did she ripped my pants down and got to her knees infront of me and started service my cock. Her gorgeous dark eyes staring up at me while she tried her best to deep throat my cock was mind blowing. Not only this, she was very attentive to my sensitive spots and would torture me with them and giggle at the sight of me shaking. 

After I came I was hard again a few minutes later and ready to feel her little Japanese pussy. She layed out on the bed and I got the tip of my cock slightly in before she pushed me back and told me no! No..no? I couldnt understand, she then smirked and stood up and whispered in my earth ""you must wait"" she got dressed and told me to get my clothes on too because she wanted to have dinner.

I stood there with my throbbing cock, confused and aroused haha this woman was teasing the fuck out of me and I loved it. So we went back out for a couple of hours and had dinner before heading back to the airbnb. The whole time all I could think about we fucking her brains out, I think this is exactly what she wanted.

We finally get back. She has a shower straight away and tells me to have one after her. After mine, i come out and see her on the bed wearing thigh highs and nothing else. They were pinching in her skin ever so much that it caused a slight dimple in the skin, so hot!

She sits down on the bed and gestures me over and stops me when im leaning down to kiss her. She puts her hand on my head and pushes me down so i am level with her pussy and demands me to eat it and you bet I did. Her pussy tasted incredible and I could tell from sliding a finger into her pussy that it was gonna be tough when my cock was going to enter.

After willingly complying to her demands and eating her pussy she told me that i had waited long enough and now i was allowed to enter her. We started with her on her back and her holding her legs back. It took abit of work and some lube, but that moment of penetration where her eyes shut tight, mouth gasped, head back and hands gripped the blanket beneath her is an image and feeling i'll never forget.

I had to work her tight pussy slowly to begin with though and as she became more used to my girth she started to push against me and as my cock pushed a little further in each time she would let out a sigh. When we finally worked it in and we could build up a good rhythm it was amazing. This gorgeous Japanese woman taking my cock and shaking and one put she was moaning so hard i could see a vessel form on her forehead before she finally gasped for air and let go of the blankets.

After seeing her let go i decided to lean down and scoop her up. Her legs dangling over my arms and i held onto her cute little ass. She put her arms around my neck and held on while I pounded fuck out of her pussy but she could only handle this for a couple of minutes because it was beginning to hurt.

So I placed her back onto the bed on all fours and teased her pussy and clit from behind with my cock before slowling re-entering her incredible pussy. With her thrust in she would push back. Her ass was the tight little thing but enough meat for me to grab a handful with each hand and pound away her. 

There was a moment I looked up and realised how cool everything was about this too as i looked out the window and saw osaka castle lit up and i stopped for a moment, still inside her and told her to look too. She shared the same enthusiasm of how cool this experience was. We went back to push each others sexual limits and fucking like animals for the rest of night.

We lazed around in bed together the next morning before we had a couple more rounds of sex and then check out. We got brunch. Went to some cool bamboo forest and shrines. We said our goodbyes and that was that. We still keep in touch but we are both busy. Hopefully when I'm in Japan next we'll be able to hook up again :)"	True	0	1506816050		0	0	dnqil9c	True	t3_73igc4	t3_73igc4	/r/AsiansGoneWild/comments/73igc4/my_time_with_a_mature_japanese_lady_story_in/dnqil9c/	1509189626	9	False	AsiansGoneWild	t5_2wm0g

I cringe that they're drinking while on medication. That's extremely risky behavior with antidepressants because you're giving two types of mood changing drugs. I'm on antidepressants and am now abstaining from alcohol. I don't know anything about stroke meds but I can't see that being a greenlight on consuming ethynol, which is the scientific name of alcohol.

I would bring it up very delicately and with a heaping amount of support. An unexpected job change after 30 years is a very stressful thing to happen. It's right up there with school, marriage, and funerals. Being depressed is hard and requires a lot of unrequited support.  Try doing activities or planned days where you spend most of the day together. 

Even with the best intentions they aren't going to change unless they want to.

I'm looking for a doujin where There's a guy that tells his friend he's going to confess to a girl. Then the guy is alone in a coffee shop and the girl is the barista. He orders a coffee and tries to make small talk, from time to time the girl goes to the kitchen were he can't see her.

We see that the girl goes out from the back exit and has sex with the guy's friend. She knows that the guy wants to confess to her and she wants to be with him. The friend comes inside her so he uses an special cork-like thing to close her pussy so the semen doesn't come out, he promises to remove it when the guy confesses.

As time passes, the guy doesn't confess, the girl keeps coming out and the friend fucks her ass.

In the end she can't take it anymore and she leaves the guy hanging asking the friend to remove the cork and fuck her.

The doujin ends with the friend lamenting that the guy never confessed, and that he would definitely enjoy her while the girl is filled with semen on all holes and discarded on the ground.

The doujin also had a mini 2 pages story at the beginning where the girl has sex with the friend in a fitting room at a clothing story.

And I do realize that a lot of good stories and gameplay hide behind themes and subject matter I'm not a fan off like sports, but this game looks really charming and delightful.

I'm in engineering, so my use of terminology is definitely different from how scientific fields use it, and there's differences even among fields of science. I was thinking that 'data' is almost like a unit of measurement. How much data supports a proposition/theory is often a measure of its likely accuracy. So in this way I wish it were standardized so we could use data vocabulary to communicate how much confidence we have. Saying ""we have datum supporting it"" should be higher confidence than ""we have data supporting it"". But obviously context would make this apparent most of the time. Anyway, good answer."

I'm not sure why it's beyond belief that some person who owns a shirt making business took the time to make this because he thought it'd get someone's attention.

There's a drive through safari park here in the UK where I live. You can buy a box of food and the giraffes come and stick their heads in the car to get some eats.  It's so much fun. 

Congratulations on the book! Think my daughter will love it.

EDIT: For those of you that asked it's West Midlands Safari Park in Kidderminster, UK. I haven't been for years but at one point went every birthday for a five year stretch. 
There used to be a monkey section too but they had to close it due to the monkeys royally screwing up cars.

Secondly who knows maybe you could reinterpret it, but the reason they would get laughed at is because there would be reasons to go against that belief. People also did interpret Daniel, and Revelation for thinking the end times were in the 70s-80s because of the cold war. And actually that belief was a big reason the modern version of the rapture is still professed today, so they were not laughed at.

Yet you kinda further compounded the point of my post: you happily embrace things that are fully supportive of your view, and stop caring, or ignore everything you dislike. 


I would seriously suggest recognizing that your side in anything may not be perfect, and that you need to take on challenging views otherwise you risk falling into the same trap that the FSA fell into where they became so full of hatred and willing blindness to the evil that claimed to support their revolution, that they allowed themselves to be so distanced from reality that none saw how the evil had long usurped their cause. 


So my question to you:

Every song made from Rock Band 1 through 2 plus all the DLC contains Stage Kit commands to go along with the song. Rock Band 3 actually did not support the stage kit at launch (due to it's low sales), but a later patch added it back in, although I think all RB3 DLC and disc songs just had a sort of ""generic"" stage kit support based off BPM or something.

The reason it was 360 only is the stage kit re-uses the rumble information channel for a standard controller to send the stage kit controls for what it does. Since the PS3 did not support rumble at all at the time, it never got the stage kit."

Considering he wore cop-as-pig socks and made some ridiculous statements admiring Che Guevara, it's pretty clear he has absolutely no freaking idea what he's talking about. Some would say its a publicity play to go out as a martyr for social injustice when he wasn't good enough to justify his massive contract or hold on to an NFL job. He found a way to stay relevant. People forget that pretty much everyone in the SF locker room hated this dude before he ever did anything political, even going back to their 2013 SB run.

0	helenadendritis				"I'm a seamstress, do mostly costuming and reenactment garb. Being an empath in this line of work is incredibly helpful because most people know what they want, but have zero idea how to put words to the vision in their heads. Just through conversation  (in person, of course!), I can get a solid feel for my clients' costuming desires. They seem to think it's magic that I ""just get them."" :)  Oddly enough, I'm certain my empath abilities also translate into an ability to make things that fit perfectly the first time they try them on.

(Just a note: I did *not* go to school for fashion design or tailoring. I'm self-taught.)

Anyway, the point here is that your coworker doesn't necessarily need to go into typical ""healer"" type work. If she enjoys working with her hands and being creative, there are jobs that involve working with the public *and* creative activities. Interior design, home remodeling, custom sewing, commissioned art... heck, even designer cakes. And, if her parents are dead-set on her going to college, these are all things that she can get an Associate or Bachelor degree in.

(Re: student debt... tell her she can start her higher education at a community college for her ""basic"" courses and then transfer to a 4-year school. Saves a ton of money!

0	valuedota				"2) Mechanics is basically reaction time similar to gun skill.  All that you listed is relevant with one additional important note.  In Dota you acquire two resources: gold and experience.  You get these resources in three ways, killing creeps, killing enemy heroes, and killing towers.  In the early game killing creeps is the most important way to get these resources. The mid lane is as close at it gets to a fair fight (its a neutral lane not closer to either teams base and historically was played as a 1v1 contest) so there is a lot of contesting over last hits (also known as CS).  So people that find success in the mid lane tend to have really good reactions to win these 1v1s.  Also a lot of mid heroes are ""flashy"" with fast movement based abilities.  So you usually want your most mechanically talented player located there.

3) The offlaner is probably the most vulnerable (its sometimes called the hard lane) since you are usually playing 1 vs 2 or 3 heroes.  But mid and the mid tower are often a very important early advantage and the focus of a lot of action early on in the game.  Since you can teleport to towers and they give vision the mid tower (with its neutral central location) is a very important objective to open up space on the opponents side of the map.

Recently the ""new meta"" has been the position 4 player sitting mid, turning mid into a duel lane vs its historical 1v1.  The nice thing about Dota is that there aren't really fixed positions for how you set up your lanes.  Every team will send 1 hero to each lane, but what you do with your two supports depends on draft and strategy.  You can go aggro and send them all to the offlane, you can have 1 in the safe lane and 1 roam, etc.  

4) Depends on the team, a lot of times coaches in Dota are picked up right before a LAN since they are often pro players that didn't qualify for the LAN.  For instance Pajkatt was the coach of DC during their TI6 2nd place run (Misery's team) since his team wasn't able to qualify."

This preview implies he disappeared sometime before they launched their assault against the Cancerverse creatures and that Rich taking the full Nova force partially fucked him up.

But seeing how much of a minor player Robbie was in Thanos Imperative I really don't mind that much if all of that was changed, especially considering where I think Duggan is going with Robbie.

That said Duggan mentioned this issue is going to be heartbreaking, and I think we're also suppose to find out who Talonar is in this issue (if not we will know before October ends), coupled with the fact that ot might be the reunion between Rich and Peter, yeah I'm preparing for a tearjerker (and going by his Deadpool run Duggan can do depressing scenes).

It doesn't really come out that much, cause her subtitles normally just drop ""g""s from ""ing"" and turns you/your to ya/yer. She also uses a lot of Yiddish, which is much more common in New York. 

Granted, I've never been to New York, so I was mostly just listening to and miming speakers and stereotypical New Yorker characters. If anybody's got some Brooklynisms, slam them in my inbox. 

I guess I could have her target lines back saying that she doesn't know where this ""America"" city is, but later Marionette calls her a Westerner, which means Aimee can't have already corrected her. I don't mind finding a way to make this dialogue work, but I think we'll need to collaborate a bit.

0	Temmon			#2: 2/13/18(ish). #1: 3/1/16.	"I was also overweight going into pregnancy, and I lost weight both pregnancies during the first half. I finally stabilized at the same weight as my last visit at my 20 week appointment. I think I followed the same trend last time, but I still only gained a net 7 pounds when my 7 pound baby was delivered. But she was 7 pounds 5 ounces at 38 weeks and perfectly healthy. She always measured on track, and my doctor never said anything negative. I also went on to gain all the baby weight from stress and comfort eating postpartum. :/ Really, if your baby is growing well and your doctor isn't worried, especially if you have fat stored up, weight gain isn't strictly necessary. You and baby both will be fueled off your stored fat (which is the purpose of it). You just really want to make sure you're getting enough calcium (baby will leach it straight out of your bones if you're not getting enough from your diet). And keep up on your prenatal vitamin.

So my appetite is pretty small. I just can't eat much at a sitting and loading up at meals isn't an option for me. Figure out healthy, reasonably energy dense foods you can snack on through the day like nuts and cheese, fruits and veggies. I like to nibble on beef jerky sometimes or peanut butter. I also started drinking milk sometimes, mostly because I think it's tasty but I only seem to when I'm pregnant."

But on topic RobinF's defensive stats are better than Indigo due to her physical bulk, Indigo requires lots of work to make work in dealing with the more advanced players with heavy merged BLyn's and Reinhardts, which are really common personally. Compared to RobinF who with a few merges can counter +10 opposition running double goads and hone.

Indigo requires bowbreaker (or lots of spurs) to kill a BLyn that runs Mulagir. Ignoring defensive battles, at neutral atk, a simple +6 atk from any source (Ex. Hone/Ally Support) is enough for Indigo to kill a BLyn running Brave Bow, this of course changes dramatically if they run fortify as well. 

The simplest way for Indigo to deal with Blyn is bow breaker, which comes at an expense for some in the form of WoM or GTB.

Meta Reinhardt's running QP/DB/DB3/Moonbow with 1 hone and goad can still kill a unmerged RES Indigo not running buffs, requiring +3~5 res to handle hone x1goad/x2 goads, which can be simply Fort Res1 Seal+Ally Support+HP/Res Seal on Indigo.

tl;dr unmerged Indigo will help against unmerged opposition like a prince charming. But against more invested teams, not so much without severe buff work, you'll probably sacrifice something to fit him to do his job when he needs to pull the weight of his intended roll.

Funny story, my friend dropped 300$ on a high end HOTAS n throttle but in the end it was so heavy there was no way he could whip the stick around fast enough or pull/push the throttle fast enough to be effective in combat.  At 30$ I could swing the thing all over the place without worrying about breaking it.

The blue bouncer murders his first form and with the smoke dash, you can dash through him as he charges so you don't need to worry about the ducks. 

Switch to the shotgun for the second part. That murders the dogs. The key hear is to kill this part right AFTER the second train so you don't have to worry about that when his third form appears. 

For the third you get under him and use the blue lob shot. You can dash through his green horse shoe attacks if you happen to be in front of him. 

For the last form use the blue lobber. Also use your super attack right as the teacups are descending. Stay on the teacup and shoot. Once he spawns those green guys drop to the middle and kill a couple and hop back up to the teacups and let the train kill the other two.

0	Mr_Potamus				You are assuming a lot.  The fact is I have played organized football, as well as other sports.  I've also been a coach for the past few decades.  These boys didn't go out drinking the night before the game, they didn't celebrate in the endzone, they didn't get into a fight...  They wanted to bring attention to an issue even though they were warned.  To me, they believed in what they did and were willing to suffer the consequences even if those consequences were because their coach felt his beliefs were more important than theirs.  As a coach, I'm not a huge advocate of those kneeling during the anthem, but I also respect their right to do it.  The right to a peaceful protest is what makes this country great.  It's small and petty to abuse your power as a coach to punish players for something like this.

0	BillGoats				"Thanks! I briefly looked into accordion tables earlier, and also noticed that it's possible to insert them in Dreamweaver. Is it a good idea to do that, then modify the code or should I start with some other sample code?

Also - an issue I had when playing around with accordion tables was that I couldn't collapse all panels simultaneously, and was forced to have exactly one expanded at all times. Can this behaviour be changed so that they all start collapsed and only expand/collapse when clicked?

Would it be reasonable to put an accordion table inside another? Cause it seems to me like I'd have to to achieve two levels as intended. While we're at it, would it be possible to dynamically add panels to both levels based on the imported data (mentioned in point 3 in the OP)?

Lastly; how flexible are accordion tables when it comes to styling? I'm a little picky when it comes to design.

0	Anzai				"Vietnam and Korea were to stop the spread of communism. That's preemptive war. You can't get much more trigger happy than that. And the bombing campaigns in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos could definitely be described as carpet bombing. The amount of UXO there is incredible, as well as ongoing effects from agent orange and the near indiscriminate use of napalm. That war was trigger happy and far more unjustified than anything Obama or Clinton did. Same with BUsh Jr and both of his major wars that are still ongoing.

Obama showed restraint against Syria, refusing to bomb without congressional approval which he did not get, whereas Trump did exactly that seemingly on a whim. Obamas use of drones, however, is unconscionable. I just don't see where you are drawing this distinction apart from the fact that the two administrations you mention are Democrats, and the others are Republican. I'm still calling partisanship. I'm not American, I'm not a democrat or a republican, but I can spot hypocrisy when I see it."

0	PepsiPerfect				"I, too, spent a great deal of time trying to figure out what the Roadhouse characters had to do with the main story. I thought they had to tie into Audrey because of the ""Billy"" and ""Tina"" connections. Alas, we are left with no resolution on this, just like we are left with no resolution on Audrey whatsoever.

I think your instincts are good, but that you are being too specific and literal with these scenes. Someone already posted the Lynch quote saying that the Roadhouse vignettes were never meant to be anything other than ""slice-of-life"" moments in the town of Twin Peaks, with no connection to the larger story. What I do think they connect to are the themes of awakening and duality. The show gives us many clues that we are watching two worlds, and that awakening is the key to crossing from one to the other.

In my opinion, the Roadhouse is a junction point between worlds. Anyone seen in the Roadhouse is not awakened in the beginning of TP, and awakens by the end.

* Audrey is the most obvious
* James was in an accident and is ""quiet"" now
* Shelly is trapped in the same self-destructive cycle of being with terrible men

The random bar conversations are part of this same routine. Whether it's drugs or insanity or infidelity, the people are all trapped in some kind of cage. When they awaken, they will be gone from the Roadhouse forever, just like Audrey.

Richard was probably trapped by his own evil heart, hence his appearance at the Roadhouse. But unlike the others, he didn't get a chance to awaken. He just got killed."

Ohhhh, I like your view on that. I think that it could be, for certain novels, but I wouldn't put the whole genre in there. This is because there are books, like mine, where the main characters aren't human and therefore it creates a different balance of things. However, I could see the validity of your point in novels that do feature humans in outlandish situations. 
My main themes that are addressed within this book are ambition, coming of age, courage, discovery, and loss.

I think that even in books that feature primarily or solely non-human characters the main scope would still fall under sociology, since it is impossible to be completely divorced from our own humanity. It would then be a view of humanity through an alien lens, but still a human view by necessity. Because if it were to be fully alien then there would be nothing for a human reader to identify themselves with. 

In the seminal ""The Dance of the Changer and Three"" by Terry Carr the only human character is the narrator who tries to explain this fully alien story to a human audience and coming to the conclusion that the story must be taken as is, because they are alien any human interpretation of this story that is so important to this alien culture must always fall flat because we cannot ever completely understand their psychology. 

The Dance of the Changer and Three teaches us that whatever we do, we will always be locked inside our own skulls, viewing the universe through human eyes. 

I  wish you the best and hope your book is a great success. :)"	True	0	1506816074		0	0	dnqilu0	True	t3_73igd9	t1_dnqils0	/r/ConciseIAmA/comments/73igd9/i_am_brianna_goux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/dnqilu0/	1509189636	1	False	ConciseIAmA	t5_3jana

I was never really a fan of the comedic styling in some of the older/no-longer-around videos, and for a while after Greg left it seemed pretty evident that Jirard may have been struggling to find his new comedic voice. But with this scene, this one side-skit, this could not have been done better. It may not be to some peoples taste, but to me, the immediate sight gag of Brett and the long drawn out ""where is this going"" Tarantino-esque vibe, followed by the perfect timing of the punchline.

0	Stonesour73				"I like to diversify my investments so check out another great site outside of the bitconnect zone. FYI I also invest with Bitconnect both of these are great platforms.
I wanted to give you another site that has been paying me and I was able to withdraw my earnings on a daily basis and the transactions are quick too! The company is called BitPetite and the concept is great! Below are few details of what they have going on and I also received a newsletter from them that they will be expanding their investment options so, I think this site is not a scam but like all HYIP's, withdraw your monies on a daily basis. So far, I have earned over $100 and have only been in it for 2 weeks. I usually test the waters first before I invest a bit more and with that said, I will be investing into LiteCoin. 2 investment options: 147% after 6 weeks and 180% after 9 weeks. Interest: 3.97% on working days and 1.00% on weekends. Minimum deposit: 0.005 BTC. Refund of the principal along with interest payments. Withdrawal minimum: 0.005 BTC or $10. Payment methods: Bitcoin or USD equivalent. Affiliate program: 10%-5%-2%. Here's the link to join this opportunity and like I always say, I am not a financial adviser thus, you are investing into these things at your own risk. But as for me, what is life without taking some small risk? Invest small and see what you think but I honestly can tell you it's worked for me thus far.

For example, my mom was spreading the word about the dangers of the TPP before the campaign started. So I would just ask her things like, ""Do know if any of the candidates have taken a position yet against the TPP...??? She'd have to answer Donald Trump. But then she'd say Rex Tillerson is a billionaire, blah, blah, blah so Trump can't be trusted to keep his word on that. 

But you're asking them to redefine who they are. They've labelled themselves as liberals, and that comes with all sorts of positive associations for them that proves to themselves that they are a good person. If they let that go, they are now a bad person according to their ideology. So they need to not only see the hypocrisy and lies and failures of progressivism, but they need pointing out, for example, that African American working poor will fare better with less illegal aliens taking jobs for low pay, etc. Or that the welfare state incentivizes fathers not living with their children, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and delinquency. Otherwise, they feel like they are abandoning all of their victims of the evil white man.

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

I reckon some familiarity with programming is probably a good idea (maybe a basic Python primer or something; it's arguably more useful than learning how to write code for Arduino depending on what your overall aims are) just so you can understand the general gist of what the code is doing. 

That said, you could just replicate my whole project and then teach yourself programming/electronics on the fly by trying to add extra features (like a buzzer, or an interface that calibrates the time thresholds to suit each user's keying speeds).

I'm really liberal, I was just arguing that if a child is having horrible seizures and parents are repeatedly neglecting appropriate treatment to the point the kid will die, our government should allow doctors to intervene regardless of the parents' culture of origin. Pretty reasonable, I don't like kids dying because of neglect.


Another student literally said ""Well that's just your western white male perspective"". It was at the same time obvious, dehumanizing, and a pointless statement and the prof backed them up.

0	sonder_lust			I become the blob.	"Fair enough.

I see a bit more actual substance to some of his claims than you do, clearly.

I agree with you, the hate crime law doesn't seem to me like a slippery slope to anything. I do agree with his proposition that you cannot codify into law preferred pronoun usage. I would never intentionally misgender someone, and I would do my best to use whatever pronoun a person prefers, but I do not want to live in a society where it's a crime if I get that wrong. I think there is reasonable room for discussion about where compassion and function meet on something like that.

I don't agree with his stance on the nuclear family and by association his criticism of other models of being. I think the nuclear family is a model that works for many people, but I know in point of fact that it does not work for many others. I think people should be free to do what they see fit. I know of no evidence that suggests gay adoption is in any way inferior to straight adoption. I wasn't aware he had made statements to that affect, but it doesn't totally surprise me that he did.

I agree that we should encourage people to embrace their gender and sexuality as fluid. More freedom and more ability to be true to one's reality is good. 

But I agree with him that there is an anti-science and anti-discourse bent to some of the present political climate on the left. I'm squarely in the left on the American political spectrum, but I sense more and more that there is a tendency to dismiss anything, whether an idea, a study, or a person, that conflicts with progressive views as so self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful as to not even deserve consideration. I sense that even in myself sometimes, and I don't like it. Some things are self-evidently wrong, ignorant, and hateful. But the vast majority of things about which people disagree are not that way. I don't see a lot of people on either side who seem interested in increasing the level of nuance to their opinions. I also feel that there is a chilling effect in much of public discourse. I don't even like the guy, but by merely talking about him and not just bashing him, I feel like I'm likely to get downvotes. I don't care about internet points, but I do think there's pressure to agree or be silent. That would just be one exceedingly silly example. The left does it to the right. The right does it to the left. That's probably always been so. But I feel increasingly the far left does it to people who basically share their goals.

I studied a fair bit of postmodern philosophy in school, which I admit was several years ago now. I kind of agree with his characterization of its issues and flaws (basically that its claims are true only in the abstract and claims that cannot be functionally applied should be treated as false, even if not logically falsifiable- like, for instance, solipsism). I do not share his opinion that the whole thing has an underlying ulterior motive of destroying Western civilization. I would be interested specifically in your take on where he strays regarding postmodern philosophy, because it's been a while for me.

I think certain academic disciplines are rather corrupt. I'm open to discussion about a lot of things, but it's wild to me that a Yale professor more or less got run out of town for questioning whether cultural appropriation is for real. Cultural appropriation, microaggressions, patriarchy, white privilege, rape culture... I think there's real, honest to God truth in this stuff, but when I really think about the world I live in, I have trouble swallowing some of it whole hog without adding at least a pinch of nuance. And if a professor at an institution can lose their job for trying to do so, how can anyone else? Shouldn't we want to know the truth about those things? Doesn't that require critical reflection?

And, for the Christianity piece, I think he makes an excellent observation (or takes one, anyway, from Dostoevsky and Neitzsche). The erosion of that as a unifying force has increased the chaos in societies. But I don't share his pessimism or resentment about it. Our society is more plural. I think the Christian tradition gave societies a toolkit. I believe that any tools from that kit that still have value will be retained, and to hell with the rest. But I don't disagree with his notion (and this was more or less Neitzsche's take) that you can toss out bad tools from Christianity, and perhaps we must, but that doesn't mean you immediately have replacements that work better. I believe we'll find them, but I do think the twentieth century had it's share of nihilism, and I do think that even today people struggle to find purpose and it can harm them. I don't mourn Christianity, and I assume we'll figure that out, but it's fair to say that, absent an externally imposed value system, people struggle to create an internal one. That's a real phenomenon in my opinion.

This is self-publishing. You literally could self-publish a book on Amazon in ten minutes. And then there are services which you pay to publish your book, like the one OP used. This form of publishing is as open and easy as it gets. If your GF wants to hold her own book in her hand, she could do it, for a price. Traditional publishing is long and hard and discouraging. When I got my first short story published in an anthology you could go to the store and buy, I cried. It was the end result of a long and hard road. I've recently finished my second full-length novel (the first one I'm trying to sell) and it's been two months of mostly rejections. But that's the game. You have to find that right agent. And then they have to find that right publisher, and so on, and three years from now I might be able to walk into a store and buy my book.

Games on stage are their best practice, do you think they want that practice time to be cut by more than half? These guys want to win worlds, they want to be the best! To be the best you have to beat the best, and to beat the best you have to practice harder than the best. Anyone who doesn't want to play more is lazy and just in it for the money, they don't have what it takes to be the best. I dare someone to ask Faker if he thinks going to Bo1 format is a good idea for a LCS regular season. He would say ""no"" and then go back to playing soloq.

Dominant decks force players to either run the dominant strategy themselves or something that can win reliably against it. This severely limits the amount of strategies instead of diversifying them. If it gets to a point where you don't have at least one of the basic deck archetypes (like no aggro deck) you have a metagame that has warped around that dominant strategy.

Morin stays as does Hagg, FWIW I think Morin will eventually get into the top 4 as well, and I hope that Amac is sent down if not now, eventually during the season (but I ain't holdin' my breath). 

A pipe dream but I'd love to see a Provy - Gudas top pair, a Morin - Ghost second pair, and a Manning - Hagg third pair but I also don't think that will happen.

I also extra-agree with getting Sanheim top pairing minutes in the AHL because he should be a top four next year assuming he uses this year to iron out the last of his defensive game.

My guess is Jews usurped a God from Sumerian mythology to be their patron God like Catholics have patron saints. Then he became jealous and to a people who believe in the existence of many God's, but only one is 'their' personal God, he would semantically be the one true God of this small subsection of humanity.

And this is a show without a script so most people perceive it to be 100% real. So that makes her look really off to the Japanese and Asian viewers, the majority of the Terrace House audience.

That’s just my two cents on her. I just think she’s very hypocritical and obviously so sensitive to the criticism even if she claims she’s stronger than that."

Long answer, Norovirus is extremely contagious. Just a few parts per million can make you violently ill. You can also get reinfected over and over. Which is what happened to DS and I. 

DS was ok during the day but in the middle of the night he would wake up sick. He has autism so when he would get sick he would panic and try to out run the projectile vomiting. Every night he would run through the house projectile vomiting at least once. Every room in the house was covered in vomit except my daughter's. My bed, his bed, the couch, the arm chairs, my bookshelf, nothing was left untouched. I would spend hours cleaning every night.

He woke me up one night by puking in my face.

As you can imagine, it took a long time for the kid and I to shake it. Surprisingly, DH and DD never got sick.

EDIT: also he refused to take any meds at this point so I couldn't get anti nausea meds down him. He always ate and drank well, he was pretty much normal all day. He would just wake up every night and spend an hour or 2 puking."

The build quality is also often better, turn a pair of Ciano Farmer inside out next to a pair of Uniqlo selvedge and tell me which is better built.

There is also a matter of inherent value in the materials. Shuttle looms put out much less fabric than their modern counterparts. Boutique mills will use specific strains of cotton to achieve desired textures and fades. The dying process is often more labor intensive  and uses real indigo (most dept. stores use artificial dyes). Also, a rare deadstock fabric that only has &lt;100 bolts in existence is going to cost more than a run of the mill (literally) fabric that is being pumped out in the 1000s of yards per day."

You don't need to apologize for taking care of your mental health. I think the best thing for you to do is to rehome them pronto. Cats under 1yo are pretty easy to find homes for - they're cute! You might do well adopting an older cat. Older cats are harder for find homes for, so there are a lot of great cats looking for homes. The best thing about mature cats that their personalities are already developed so you can talk to whoever is caring for them now and find out if they are a good fit for your home."

0	rshorning				"I'm hoping that SpaceX makes fuel costs a major capital concern in the development &amp; testing of the BFR.  The only company I've ever heard had that as a major issue was Armadillo Aerospace, where I heard that fuel was about a third of their capital costs in the development of the Mod vehicle that they used in the Lunar Lander Challenge.  That was a whole lot of actual flying time for the vehicle, and it showed in the end with a very sturdy and reliable vehicle.  It is also something pretty common in terms of research teams doing VTOL rocket research to have a whole lot of flights.

That is something you have the luxury to do when you have a reusable vehicle.... which fortunately the BFR is going to be.  It wouldn't surprise me if there were over a thousand flights (perhaps just suborbital) before any passengers ever went on board.

I'm hoping that the constellation will start going up before the BFR is ready for revenue service with satellites, but that certainly is a possibility too.  I really want to see a bunch of videos [just like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXdjxPY2j_0) with the BFR in the meantime."

If I could relive just one day, it would be a day in July of last year when after more than 25 years I sat down to have lunch with my best childhood friend. We talked about all that had happened over the many years in-between. He looked so different. If you saw him walking down the street, his old clothes, his long tangled and unwashed hair, nearly all his exposed skin covered in tattoos and a cigarette hanging from his mouth, you'd have wanted to avoid him. He looked like an absolute badass who might just be completely and unpredictably violent. Except that's not who he really was on the inside. He was still the same kind and thoughtful guy I knew from my childhood. He'd had more than his fair share of misfortune. Some of it was his fault and some wasn't but he owned every bit of it. He never blamed anyone but himself. When I asked him how he manages it all he said, ""It's my life. What else can I do?""

Afterwards we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, back to our families and our lives. I was so happy to have reconnected with him and I thought we'd continue to be a part of each other's lives for many years to come.  A month later, he died unexpectedly and all alone of a heart attack. Oh how I wish I could have spent more time with him. I just didn't know there wasn't any time left."

0	MDL1994				I was in a relationship with a guy for two years, we lived together and everything. Long story short, he wasn't the guy for me and I broke up with him and moved back in with my parents. I totally didn't expect his reaction, I thought he would shrug and pretend he didn't care. He did care. He cried his eyes out and begged me to stay, asked me over and over to please stay and give him one more chance. Even clung to me and kept saying please please please, I'll do everything different! It was the hardest thing I had to do in my life, walking away and purposely hurting someone to save my own happiness. It was the hardest but also the best decision I have ever made. It has been years since then and I'm sure he had a hard time at first. There was just nothing I could do for him, every conversation we had just gave him hope we would be okay again. I'm glad he could rely on his parents for support. I felt so guilty at first, especially because I started dating someone new a lot earlier than him. However years later we are both in relationships with different people who suit us much better. I honestly think he would agree now that it was for the best. This was my personal anecdote, I hope it gives you hope that down the line everything will be okay 😊 the heavy feeling and the guilt will lessen over time, you are not responsible for his happiness. You are not obligated to stay with him so he is comfortable. Sending you strength and happiness and if you want to talk I'm here!

Of these, fear is that only one that makes sense in context, yet there really isn't any hint of that in the story. And unfortunately Blizzard has kind of left us hanging in the ""so what the hell is Sylvanas doing now"" category, so as consumers of the story, we are left to make sense of our place in it. (As you can tell, I'm thinking of this in the larger sense of the overall story and how my actions fit into it, not just some dude sitting at a computer). Of all the Horde races, the Tauren have perhaps the least checkered past, in terms of unprovoked violence or delving into black magic fuckery. It just seems... false that my tauren shaman, with his own history and the history of his race, would willingly follow Sylvanas. And her actions thus far as Warchief have not gone beyond this single, apparently self-serving mission.

You had one job to do.  Feed the dog and cat.

They trusted you with a key to their home to do that job.  Instead of doing just that, you went through all the corners of their home and figuratively rubbed your scent in it.

You showed that you have no consideration or respect for your adult son and his adult wife and their decisions about their life.  Had you been considerate, you would have offered to do a deep cleaning, listing out the things that you could do for their home.  This could have been done through a phone call or a text message and you should wait for an answer before doing anything else.  

I am very leery that you say you organized.  By that, did you straighten up a pile of papers on the table?  Or did you rearrange cupboards and furniture?  If your cleaning included more than squaring away a pile of papers so they are not on the verge of falling off the pile, you overstepped big time.  By the way your son described your actions and called you presumptuous and controlling, I suspect you did a lot more than cleaning surfaces that were dirty, other than doing laundry.

If you wanted to help, you need to ask in what form they would accept your help.  You don't barge in and start doing things without their knowledge and consent.

I have a followup question for you?  Did you keep the key or did you give it back?  If you didn't give it back (why not?), have you USED the key without their prior knowledge?  If you've used the key, you are more than an asshole very much deserving of the cold shoulders thrown your way."

What I am saying is that Mercy changes the game for sure and what it changed it from is no longer can you get a pick and then roll a fight. Instead people need to force her rez, take her out and win the team battle. In reality we already killed support first and more so with Mercy. Mercy isnt broken she is strong and needs a different tactic. Much of what she does isnt different to what she used to do which is rez and shift a battle.

0	Happierre0585		happierre		"Yes, Sandmeh shows up as a random encounter on Stage 35 with Beetler and Quaken, and replaces Sgt. Burly occasionally, which actually makes the stage easier since Sandmeh has a lower attack stat.

If you're playing the U.S. version of Wibble Wobble, Sternynan is an S rank from the Tough Tribe, a Jibanyan reskin. He appears in the second hidden stage on the second map. You have to beat the end bosses Tanbo, Payn and Sandmeh with Sheen on your team. Then the stage unlocks.

Sandmeh is horrible. He had a purpose in the Liberty Way event this past spring. You would catch him and then crank for the Sand Suit to fuse him into Mr. Sandmeh. He would then get an attack damage boost when fighting Libertynyan S. Now he's only in this event along with other past event Yo-kai just so people who missed out can add to their Medallium. I don't really need him, I was just trying to earn all of the stars for the sake of it. It means nothing because they're not offering rewards for earning all stars for this particular event.

Si vous saviez comment j'éprouve une profonde admiration pour les gens de cette chaîne. Ils m'ont aidé à travers des moments où j'aurais pu être fâché, triste, mais leurs chansons m'ont donné la motivation de continuer, parfois.
Ces œuvres m'ont permis de réfléchir plus loin, de mieux comprendre l'immense univers de Tolkien, au-delà de ce que j'aurais pu m'imaginer. Je n'écoute pas les paroles, je les vis, je vie les personnages dont ils chantent l'histoire.
Je les chantonne également très souvent, peut-être un peu trop pour les gens qui m'entourent qui, surtout mes amis, semblent à mon grand désespoir avoir une aversion pour ce genre musical. Comme si le rap moderne signifiait quelque chose. La musique classique peut atteindre un point de mon cœur qui se trouve intouchable par le pop et les autres genres.
Les membres de Clamavi De Profundis sont divins.

0	OneCatch		0015		"Does it have a crew which can respond intelligently? Or are they restricted to staying buttoned up inside the vehicle and won't intervene if I, say, get on top of it? If the former, I'm completely dead. If the latter, I might, just might, survive. Unescorted tanks aren't great at urban environments, and it has to find me to kill me.  


I'm on a UK-style housing estate - lots of two-story brick buildings, hedges, fences. Roads aren't in a grid, it's all cul-de-sacs and tight bends. Not much line of sight. Now the Abrams has thermal and night vision kit, but that's mostly directional and generally trained on the forward arc (as are the weapons). It won't be able to see through, say thick hedgerows, walls, buildings, or fences. Obviously if it actually sees me I'm dead. But since I know the estate quite well I can probably evade it reasonably easily, for a small time at least.  
So my plan is to collect some firelighters and kindling materials, and a load of ceramic plant pots. I'm also buying some duct tape, rope, some food and water. And a few of those foil emergency blankets. I'm going to make a bunch of small fires all over the place, and use them to heat the ceramic pots. These are to serve as false heat signatures all over the place.  
Meanwhile, I'll be in an alley across the street, behind a fence, covered in the foil blankets to conceal body heat. The tank will probably use the road to get to my address because my cul-de-sac is relatively inaccessible without driving through other houses. That puts me right behind it, at which point I run and climb right on top of the turret. That'll take like 5 seconds, so hopefully I'm not spotted.  Once on top I lie spread eagled, and securely rope/tape myself to whatever stanchions and protuberances there are on top, in order to avoid exhausting myself or falling off. Then wait for 24 hours to win!

The main reason i like her is that she goes on curve better than wotf, because turn  5 is usually time where you want to play Teena/EPM/use DoD or whatever else. Turn 6 is often period where some combo pieces are already gathered, so its time to stall/clear the board while waiting for lethal range and/or more combo pieces.

0	spawn1080				"Hah! I had to hop off the cab in a minute, so I could only write ""Retinol and Lactic Acid alternate PM, and sunscreen AM.""


Here's the full routine:


AM:


Wash with water&gt; Timeless CE Ferulic&gt; Hydrating Toner&gt; Jojoba/Grapeseed Oil&gt; CeraVe moisturizing lotion&gt;Sunscreen

PM 1:

DIY oil cleanser if I have sunscreen/makeup on&gt; CeraVe hydrating cleanser&gt; Hydrating Toner&gt; Hylamide SubQ serum&gt; TO Lactic Acid 5%/Alpha Skin Care 10% Glycolic gel&gt; Rosehip seed/Passion fruit oil&gt; CeraVe PM/Stratia LG&gt; CeraVe healing ointment

PM2:

Same up to serum, then Oil&gt; TO Advanced Retinoid 2%&gt; Moisturizer&gt; Occlusive


I wait the suggested time between products. With sunscreen it's usually more than 30 mins+ after moisturizer. I work from home, so I have the luxury of stretching out my AM routine. I also don't have to wear sunscreen or makeup every day.


Toners I use: Klairs Supple Preparation, Hada Labo Gokujyun Moist, Kiku Masamune Sake High Moist


Sunscreens: Neogen Day-Light on dry days, Anessa Aqua Booster Mild SPF 50 on humid days

What should who have done better? Trump?

Pre-stage the USNS Comfort prior to the hurricane, just like what was done for hurricane Matthew. 

Dispatch another two LHDs to accompany the Wasp. 

Open transport for power companies and personnel on the SE Atlantic coast as soon as the SJ airport was cleared. 

Issue National Guard mobilization to support the Puerto Rico units (they have a few of their own NG units there, but not enough)

Yeah helicopters would perform supply airdrops of food and water while the USCG performed air medevac to SJ to await the Comfort, however would be in a central triage location with access to supplies as needed. 

In summary, what they are saying they are going to do really soon, but about 5 days ago.

0	stevenvanroosmalen				"Dear Pandarth_Omega,

Luckily for you - or maybe not so much - I read your entire reply. In this comment I will be clearing some things up, setting the records straight, while replying to some of your remarks directly. Therefore I will quote your previous post in order to achieve full transparency. I feel we need this in both of our lives right now. Correct me if I'm being to presumptuous. 

**Honest**
&gt;I thank you for your honest reply

I must confess. I wasn't honest at all, for I have never read the 4th issue of The Thanos Imperative. So I merely guessed that Thanos said ""No"" in this issue. My conclusion - as you have correctly pointed out - is flawed and playfull mockery. 

**Fun**
&gt;As it seems you have not quite understood the latter point, let me put it to you as plainly as I can. This post was made for fun.

While I was teasing you with my clearly false theory - on which I will elaborate later - it wasn't my intention to give you the impression that I took your theory fully serious or that I didn't enjoy myself. Although this section isn't titled **honest**, I still believe I am when I state that my opening sentence was fully sincere. I shall quote myself here - one thing I always enjoy doing - to show you to what sentence I'm referring: ""I intensely enjoyed reading your - how shall I call it? - Theory."" Your writing style, wit and the theory itself are entertaining. I was merely inspired by your post to reply with another theory. And since I do not believe in the meaning you get from those numbers (D23), I decided to exaggerate in an even more far-fetched theory. 

**I told you so**
&gt;your telling me ""I told you so"" has no meaning

In my modest opinion. I told you so always has meaning. If nothing else, it may hint at a character flaw of the one posing this statement. 

**My clearly false theory**
&gt;I can only imagine how long it took you to accomplish this.

It took me 10 minutes. I think. 

&gt; Your theory was built on three numbers which were never shown in the film; to discover them one would have to pay very close attention to the film and, likely as not, watch it multiple times. 

I googled ""Captain America Winter Soldier Numbers"" in order to get some data quickly. I quickly found this picture: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a9/8f/9b/a98f9bce6365417da8056ae3339d8e7c.jpg
I choose three numbers - which only had in common that Captain America himself was involved - and tried googling some dates. Luckily I found that The Thanos Imperative was released on one of the possible dates. As you can see, this is no achievement at all. Of course, while having fun, I was also trying to point out that giving meaning to numbers isn't that difficult. And while I will admit, the numbers in your theory have a clearer connection to each other, I still think it isn't a meaningful one. I cannot disprove this - and since you're not that serious about it, I probably won't have to - but I simply highly, highly doubt a director or marketing team would put in coded messages about trailer drops for a movie that far ahead of time. It is way more likely that this is just coincidence (if the trailer does drop at October 14th). 

**The Trailer**
&gt;As I mentioned in my original post, a quick look through recent activity will reveal that the most popular answer is ""sometime in October""

This is likely. I think the trailer will drop around Thor: Ragnarok. This strategy will remind moviegoers that the Thor film might be worth checking out because he's in Infinity War. And we all want to know which events will lead-up to that movie. But this is merely a prediction of Marvels overall strategy. You probably wouldn't be surprised at this point that I too think the Infinity War trailer will be dropped at the end of October or the beginning of November. ""Around October"" sounds accurate to me. 

u/AdmiralSnackBar69's analysis is therefore much more reliable then your fun-to-read-theory. He doesn't look at a coded message - which we just entertainingly assume it might be a coded message - but he looks at production trends. 

**Closing**

It was never my intend to be hurtful or mock you as an author. I really enjoyed reading your text. So maybe I didn't formulate my reply as carefully as I could have. English isn't my first language, so communicating can be difficult sometimes. That being said, I don't feel you took it the wrong way. Your reply was equally entertaining. This exchange of simple words we've had today was so fun and inspiring, that I think we should become electronic pen pals. 

To summarize: 

- I had fun reading your original post and your reply. 

- I was fully aware you were not entirely serious. 

- My theory was very much incorrect. 

- I think a trailer will drop in October/November.

- While I was mocking, I hope you know by now it wasn't meant to be hurtful, personal or hateful. 


Hopefully, I cleared some things up. If not, if everything I said you already knew or assumed, then consider my post simply as meaningless rambling, attention seeking or a waste of your valuable time.

Think i read somewhere that they estimated regression to maybe 1200 yards the rest of the season (which still leaves him with over 1700), and something like 14 td's. those are STILL ridiculous numbers, so even if he comes close to that he is worth holding onto, or trading for someone great.

I may regret it, but im gonna hold onto him. People were saying to trade DJ while his value was up so high after the first few weeks he took over, and now those people look silly. he could fall off, sure. but he could take you to the ship as well.

0	Sek_3_Agora				"Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive floating abstraction: . . . a society without an organized government would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of objectivelaws and of an arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates the establishment of a government.

“The Nature of Government,”
The Virtue of Selfishness, 112

¶

If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would compel every citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to shoot any strangers approaching his door—or to join a protective gang of citizens who would fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus bring about the degeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., rule by brute force, into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages.

The use of physical force—even its retaliatory use—cannot be left at the discretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a man has to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him by any of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors’ intentions are good or bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they are motivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by malice—the use of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary decision of another.

I mean, those are OK specs, but for a ""gaming"" setup it's a bit low. The CPU is OK but the 940M should struggle in recent games, right? 

I meant no offense. I just found it weird that it would be a gaming pc with those specs, when the same specs are perfectly on par with what I'd expect from the companion PC of a 3d printer, since you still need some GPU power to design the pieces and manipulate them in software.  
That just seemed logical.

0	metenamina			We are the Sentinels	"Taking a personal stance here: I know a few good people in the community who have succeeded and are happy today after starting tulpamancy with possession. Compared to them Koomer and Ougigi are not only an exception, but as many others have pointed out today and in the past, they had several other underlying problems that are probably more connected to their issues involving tulpamancy than the skills they practiced, which further distances the problems they had from the actual practice.

Also, you call your post an opinion here, [but in your blog its title doesn't reflect the same stance](https://i.imgur.com/y15xA2D.png), although you do mention its something along that line in the very last line of your article.

Honestly, as much as it is indeed your opinion, I don't think its helpful in any way to newcomers. In fact, I think you're just painting the skills related to tulpamancy as the villains of their story.

Two won't play **food chain magnate**. They got absolutely demolished in their first game, to the point where they were ""irrelevant bystanders"" after turn 3. Never again, they said.

One won't play **alchemists** because it reminds him of being in college and he goes to game night to forget school and work.

One won't play **resistance or secret Hitler** because he's a (young) retired Afghanistan war vet with ptsd and those games trigger him too much. He gets way to stressed out.

Two friends won't play **arboretum** , and these are two really good gamers, not snowflakes. But the hand restriction is so stressful that they can't have fun with it. Of those two, one won't play **bazaar** because the thought process required to play optimally is so brain burny that he doesn't think it's worth it. That being said, he'll play fcm and battlecon with me all day, ironically.

Another friend has kids 10, 8, 6, who all like game, but they won't play **escape curse of the temple** again because the last game ended in tears, shouting, and rage. The mom and 10 year old did fine, but the 8&amp;6 struggled, and I split the group up poorly. So idiotic, I should have been with the 8&amp;6, not with the 10.

I almost won't play **splendor** anymore because it removes all socialization and leads to some outburst when someone grabs the card someone else wanted.

One guy won't play **acquire** because he ran out of money real fast, couldn't buy stocks for like 6 turns, didn't have the tiles to force a merger, and walked away feeling like it was a luck fest that punished you too hard for being careless with your money. Dunno, me neither..?

One won't play **Chinatown** because the endgame is too mathy and predictable (easy to solve).

And another won't play **dominion** anymore because it's too themeless and too pure, ie he prefers Clank, where deck building is a means to an end, not an end. By the way, he's never played a dominion expansion.

I won't play any of the **legendary** series games, **monopoly, munchkin, galaxy trucker, mice n mystics, or Robinson Crusoe** because I don't feel I have enough player agency.

The hardest thing is you two were best friends and now coping without that is so difficult. I don't really think there is a best way to move on other than time. Time is key to help yourself get over this. 

I just sent an email to my ex explaining that what we had was more of a friendship than a relationship. We were together since we were 14 and had been together 5 years. And we did love eachother but sometimes love is not enough. Have some you time and figure out who you are again before you even consider getting back with her because you'll hurt eachother again.

Like I said, for high rounds, past round 80, then yes, use no power because rounds will stay at 2:20 seconds after round 21 to 1000.

I actually did do my test before the FDA crackdown, but after that the 23andme web interface changed for me along with all new customers. However, I believe all users can still [download their raw data](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212196868-Accessing-and-Downloading-Your-Raw-Data), and then there are is some other software that could be used to analyze that data ([example](http://medicalfuturist.com/analyse-your-dna-in-your-living-room/)), which maybe skirts the FDA rules by virtue of being more DIY.

0	[deleted]				"I agree with what you're saying, but at the same time in this situation the only time oxford commas would ever be truly necessary would be either in a complex sentence or if one is writing to a person who lacks the ability to use context clues.

In your example, we'd start with the base sentence:

""I had dinner with my uncle and a madman and an accordion player.""

This obviously isn't proper grammar, so we'd replace the first ""and"" with a comma since we've created a list:

""I had dinner with my uncle, a madman and an accordion player.""

In this case anyone with a grasp on context clues would understand what one was trying to say. If this was being said aloud then it would be the burden of the person pronouncing it to clarify what they were saying.

I will submit that there are situations where an oxford comma is necessary, but they are few and far inbetween. Meanwhile our society expounds into our heads at a young age that we must always use the oxford comma whenever we write regardless of the situation.

I still use them, but only because of I've been oppressed by our society which worships them to the point where that oppression is now internalized in all within.

0	ninjasquirrelarmy				Not OP, but also a unicorn.  A friend and coworker was part of a couple but I didn’t know her very well.  He and I were texting one night and he jokingly (or so I thought) asked if I’d join them for a threesome.  I laughed it off, saying maybe if his girl asked I’d consider it.  Five seconds later she fb messages me saying he wasn’t joking but we should all get to know each other first.  We started hanging out a lot and they told me about the lifestyle and I met a lot of their like-minded friends.  The opportunity to have friendships and safe sexual relationships without the burden of a daily relationship was heaven to me after a divorce.  Three years later:  I have lots of fun, lots of great friends, the original couple and I still talk almost daily and hang out in some form every week.

0	apollo440				"Number one. Here's a good way to look at it:

If you were starting a team and could pick any QB that's ever played, there aren't many you could put above him. Elway's combination of mobility, toughness, a rocket arm and fierce competitiveness make him a compelling choice regardless of who he's compared to. Let's give give it a shot:

**Brady**: Simply one of the greatest to ever play the game, period. He's also had the benefit of playing for THE greatest head coach of all time. That has to be factored into this evaluation. Would Brady have been as great under multiple head coaches? Although we'll never know the answer definitively, history shows that it'd be very difficult to replicate Brady's success under different coaches.

Elway however went to five Super Bowls under two different head coaches. Neither of these coaches would even be in the running of GOAT. Also if you compare the QBs head-to-head, Elway is more athletic and mobile than Brady while being just as competitive (Brady's best attribute). Advantage Elway

**Favre**: I never understood why Favre was treated with such reverence when he played. Whenever I think of Favre, I think of back-breaking picks in the playoffs. That alone disqualifies him from consideration. 

**Peyton Manning** : Great QB. Gaudy stats. Four Super Bowl appearances with four different head coaches. I wouldn't start him over Elway though. Elway is more mobile and tougher, but his biggest advantage is that he played his best ball under pressure. That's Peyton's biggest weakness. That's a big weakness of most QBs. 

**Marino**: Well he was a great QB to be sure. I think his stats were better than Elway overall. But Marino had a downside. I read recently he had less than 100 yards rushing for his ENTIRE career. So even if Marino was a better passer than Elway, I'd consider his lack of mobility to be a significant disadvantage. Also--and this probably isn't all his fault necessarily-- he played for two Super Bowl winning coaches and only had one SB appearance.  Elway took three Reeves-coached squads to the Super Bowl that had no business being there. That's how good he was.  Quick who was Elway's top receiver on those teams? Who was his running back? I can't remember and I actually WATCHED those teams! 

**Montana** : Joe Montana was a fucking great QB and arguably is the GOAT. As a fan of both the Broncos and Cowboys (don't ask), I had the pleasure of having my heart ripped out by this muthafucker for over a decade. Accurate, cool under fire with the heart of a champion.  But here's the thing about Montana...dude was fragile by NFL standards. If you put a solid lick on him, he wouldn't get up. That's why he didn't finish his career as a 49er. Toughness is important in this position. Elway was a tough sumamabitch.

Try their song Trauma Model or Alpha &amp; Omega from their most recent album. They also have some songs similar to rapcore. Deez Nuts is a good rapcore band.

0	matcht				"Think he's reading into Moreno's comments a bit too much. Anyone who watches us closely will have noticed that we don't press anywhere near as much anymore, and it's a conscious change.

Could be many reasons for it. One is that we have the CL this season so we can't afford to play such a high energy game every week. We don't have that deep of a squad, and Klopp thus far has only really rotated in the full back areas. City/Spurs have rotated far more effectively than us. Also worth remembering we have the CL playoff round which added games for us, while having to deal with the absence of Clyne, Lallana, Coutinho and dealing with bringing back players from injury (Hendo/Mane/Sturridge).

Another is that pressing, while effective, when it isn't working, leaves your midfield and defence exposed. Notably when Lallana is missing, we don't have a natural doggish presser aside from Firmino, so Klopp is being pragmatic in the absence of Lallana in order to protect our already vulnerable defence. I can imagine Klopp remembers playing a high pressing game away at Bournemouth or Leicester and then getting caught by simple long balls into the channels.

I remember when Klopp first arrived, the number of hamstring/calf injuries was ridiculous. These injuries have slowed down somewhat, but a less intensive pressing game will have helped."

0	milnesand				"The Left has leaned right over the years. Both parties have. Obamacare originated with the Heritage Foundation in the 80's. The Left absolutely refused to pass it when Gingrich was pushing it in the '90's. Once Obama was president, the Left loved it and the Right hated it. 

The NSA's domestic spying is literally fascist. Not the Left's new definition which is ""Trump supports it"", but actually fascist. Both the Right and the Left largely support it out of fear, but it's a very far right program. It wouldn't have been allowed before 9/11. 

Trump has changed his position on things over the years. Most people do. There's no shame in that, as long as the changes don't happen from interview to interview. Trump has been consistently leaning farther and farther to the right over the last several decades. 

I have no idea why you think the country has been moving Left. I've been watching politics since the 90's. We've moved to the Right. You'd think people on the Right would consider that a victory, but somehow y'all have twisted it into an imaginary defeat.

0	JSryder3894				"I have to agree with a lot of the critiques here.  The pilot showed a lot of promise, but the show just went down hill from there.  The show had so much potential to be an accurate portrayal of the origins of hip hop and how the culture of the 70s in NYC really influenced not only a generation but changed the landscape of the music industry in general.  

But sadly they just didn't portray it very realistically and it wasn't, like someone else said, raw or real enough.  And don't get me started on the whole rape scene where Leslie Lesgold forces Jackie Moreno to go down on her because he once coerced her into giving him a blowjob and then fired her way back when she interned for him.  Really?  Such BS and so completely unrealistic.  I lived through that era, women got used and sexually exploited all the time and not just in the music industry.  Back then it was the unofficial and deeply repulsive status quo that in order for a woman to get a ahead, pardon the pun, she had to give head and much more. If she didn't play that game she got black listed and her career was over.  

Once a woman gained stardom then it was different story, but even then the male power players of the day ran the show and their word was law.  Back then no woman would dare pull some revenge crap like Leslie did, because no male power player then would ever allow a woman to have that kind of power.  Sorry ladies but rape revenge like what Leslie did, however empowering and entertaining, was not only not practical but due to the culture of the time would never have happened. So yeah that was the big BS exclamation point on the ending of that show, that and the ridiculous amount of money Netflix spent on it.  The Get Down deserved to get cancelled.  Overall though, with all of Netflix's other hit shows, one miss like the get down shouldn't hurt their overhead much at all.  They are still hitting it out of the park with shows like Luke Cage and Stranger Things, as well as a lot of their other original shows and the ones they currently got in development.  The Get Down will barely end up as a hiccup in what has become Netflix's original show money making machine.

0	spyrothedovah				"The ones released in Australia (the mini version) seem to be selling on eBay way cheaper than the NES classic was. I missed out on the NES classic mini and the listings were around $300-$500 each. So obviously I didn't get one.

For the SNES Classic mini, I missed out on preorder again, went on eBay and they were selling on preorder for around $40-$50 more than the release price. Which isn't *too* bad, I guess. Maybe no one bought the ridiculously overpriced ones so they had to lower them, who knows.

But that said, I went to the local department store 6 hours after they opened expecting them to have sold out hours earlier, but they still had plenty so I was able to get one (they said they received about 50-60, and they had a line up in the morning but it's a small town. Some major stores got hundreds and hundreds. When the NES was released they got 12. And a lineup of furious people yelling at the employees for not having enough)

Maybe Nintendo learned after the NES fiasco, but it was still cool to get one and not have to pay stupid amounts for it.

0	Orphic_Thrench				Yes, it is a male sex organ.  Being attracted to a woman who has non-standard sex organs doesn't make you gay.  I mean, if someone is solely fixated on the penis, and doesn't care for the rest of the person, that might mean something different.  But that's not what people are typically doing.  Bailey Jay is considered by a lot of people to be good looking and *also* she had a penis.  Random penises are not what these people are into - they're just more open about non-standard genitalia.

0	Uncle_Lenny				"Sad story time. 

I was 6 years old and had family friends over just before Christmas. My mom was single and working a ton to support my sister and I at the time. 

Anyways, we didn't want our friends to leave so we hid in the laundry room.  Low and behold, I stumble across the technodrome hidden behind the furnace. We book it out of there, and agree not to say anything. 

So they leave, and it's just the 3 of us at the kitchen table. I was so excited about it that I kept dropping hints until it was obvious and she just broke down crying. I had never seen her cry before, and granted she was stressed from everything but its probably the worst memory I have with her. She tried so hard to make a perfect Christmas and circumstances (as I know I was a kid and didn't do it on purpose) just took that away from her, as was common in general for her. 

I didn't even ask for that present but she knew I loved TMNT and got me the best present ever. It was my last Christmas with her.

0	2airbendes		g4	Pegasus Knight	"You're assuming way too much about the average player here when it's a huge player base, there's no way everyone started when the game started. People still complain about no Camus/Xander repeat because they started after that point. There's no way everyone has the same goal of collecting every unit at 4* level 40 when there's literally no point to that either. The only thing the game actually tracks is 5* level 40s. F2P have limited barrack space and limited supplies of feathers, so there's nothing in game even wanting you to do this. I've upgraded literally 7 total units to 5* with the amount of Feathers I've gathered since I started playing and I don't have enough to upgrade someone to 5* right now. And two of those were 4* s I pulled and wanted to build up, like a ton of other users would want to do with their favorite units, which would be a much more important goal for them than raising their Virion to 4* level 40 using the Feathers and stamina they would've otherwise put into a +10 Selena or something. 
Even if somehow there was several thousand like minded individuals who did that, you'd still not be able to follow a lot of guides because they require 3* s, and throwing off stats even IV wise entirely messes up strategies. Some strategies need people like Arthur or Stahl or Serena there at 3* because they can soak hits, but won't kill a specific unit at a choke point. So bringing your 4* Serena/Arthur/Stahl means you mess up the strategy, the Axe you were stalling dies, and the Lance behind it kills Serena/Stahl instead. 
 
Besides the whole ""yeah but what if this or what if that"", the entire point is ""what if people don't have this"", your argument here is ""well, they should"", my point is ""yeah, but they don't"". How does your argument actually fix the situation those people are in who see that video about the easy 4* Oboro level 40 wall strategy, and then realize they'd have to spend like 150 stamina and 2000 Feathers just for this one orb they're wanting to earn?

There's a study where the surgeon randomly assigned patients to a fake knee arthroscopy vs a real one, without telling the patients. Pain was reduced equally in both groups... 

[This multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled trial involving patients with a degenerative medial meniscus tear showed that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy was not superior to sham surgery, with regard to outcomes assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. Although both groups had significant improvement in all primary outcomes, the patients assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy had no greater improvement than those assigned to sham surgery.](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1305189#t=article)

Pick record: 23-2-16

Bonus Picks record: 17-1-23
***

*Had a decent day yesterday. The POTD pick - Coventry won, and I got 4/6 picks as winners with one other as a push*

**POTD:**

**Double: Torino to Win &amp; Inter Milan to Win - 1.60 (L - 2-2 &amp; 1-2. Torino concede 2 goals in the last 6 minutes to lose the bet, unbelievable!)**

Now I like to stick to singles, especially for POTD but after researching through all the games I like today there's nothing that puts me over the edge for certainly other than these picks. I was thinking of doing the Lazio game O2.5 goals as I can see both teams scoring there or even Lazio scoring 3 just themselves but I'm not 100% confident and a 2-0 win in that game wouldn't surprise me. 

So, into detail about Torino's game. They host Verona today who I've talked about in previous picks about how utterly terrible they are and if reports are to be believed their manager is close to the sack. Verona have looked hopeless through 6 games with a record of 0-2-4, only scoring 1 (from a penalty) and conceding 14. 

Torino have been decent so far this season. They find themselves 7th with a record of 3-2-1, goals 10:9. Attackers Belotti and Ljajic have been in good form with 3 goals each and are very likely to score today, Belotti has scored in the two home games Torino have played so far. With Verona's horrible scoring record I doubt they'll score today but if they do it'll only be 1 and Torino have more than enough quality to get 2+. Defensive mid Baselli will be missing after being sent off last week, Obi &amp; Barreca will also miss out for the hosts but they'll be able to cope without them. 

In the other game, Inter play away to Benevento who are equally as bad as Verona and sit in last place, also just scoring the 1 goal and have conceded 16 goals already after being smashed by Napoli 6-0 and Roma 4-0. It won't get any easier for them here against Inter who have won 5 and drawn once in their games and have the best defensive record in the league. 

Inter were lucky to win last week against Genoa, but they continued their record of scoring in every game. That comes mostly thanks to Icardi who is up to 6 goals already and will like his chances of bagging a couple today, I might put a little on him to even get a hat trick. As far as injuries go Inter are only missing Cancelo who hasn't played in a month anyway. It could be a rout here after some of Benevento's performances but Inter don't tend to be a big scoring team so I'm expecting 2-0/3-0 here.

*Quite a lot of games I like today, so I'll try to whittle them down to just the better looking ones for picks*

**Picks:**

• **Arsenal v Brighton - Arsenal Clean Sheet YES - 1.80 (W - 2-0)**

Originally this pick was going to be Arsenal to Win to Nil but the odds so similar for just a clean sheet that it seems much more worth it in case Arsenal can't score somehow. 

Arsenal have kept their last 6/8 home matches as clean sheets. They've shown how impressive at home they are winning all their games so far conceding all their only hole goals let in in that early 4-3 thriller against Leicester. 

Brighton have struggled for goals this season, they're scored 5 in 6 (3 goals coming against West Brom) and have only scored 1 away from home so far. To get a better look at how I expect this game to play out I looked at how they faired against their only big team they faced yet Man City and the stats show a 79/21% possession to Man City, showing that Brighton are likely to sit back and try to grind out a draw today against Arsenal. 

• **Everton v Burnley - Burnley or Draw - 2.25 (W - 0-1)**

I fucked up here, looking at the odds Burnley +1.0AH @1.65 are a much better pick than this so if you're reading this pick late I would take that, I still feel Burnley can draw here and I won't change my pick after the fact so here are the stats. 

Burnley have performed well this season with a record of 2-3-1, goals 6:5. Away from home Burnley have really turned it on after a terrible record last season, this season they won at Chelsea 2-1, as well as getting 1-1 draws at Spurs &amp; Liverpool. If Burnley do lose it tends to be only by a goal, although last season Everton were one of the only teams able to beat by that margin winning 3-1 but this is a different Everton this year. 

Everton have struggled for goals. They've scored 4 in 6, 2 of them coming last game where they were fortunate to get away with a win. Koeman is under pressure at the moment and will want to continue Everton's winning streak. If Burnley are able to get the first goal then the Goodison Park crowd will be booing and they will get on their players backs, that pressure might be too much. 

• **Atalanta v Juventus -- BTTS - 1.95 (W - 2-2)**

The head to head record here has BTTS in the last 4/6. Atalanta have had 5/6 BTTS too. Both teams have scored in all of their games so far (except for when Juve played Barca). I think both teams will fancy their chances and have inform players on either side in Gomez and Dybala. I like the O2.5 goals here too, it was 2-2 in this game last season and it could be agin today. 

• **Torino v Verona -- Torino Clean Sheet YES - 2.20 (L - 2-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

• **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -2.0 Asian Handicap - 2.20 (L - 1-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

• **Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter to Win to Nil - 1.95 (L - 0-2)**

Explained in POTD. 

• **Hertha Berlin v Bayern Munich -- Hertha Berlin to Score 1+ goals - 1.90 (W - 2-2)**

I've explained this pick in a comment below. 

• **Koln v RB Leipzig -- Leipzig to Win - 2.00 (W - 1-2)**

• **Nice v Marseille -- Nice Draw No Bet - 1.92 (L - 2-4. Nice we're 2-0 up! That would have paid out with some bookies Ina straight win, how annoying)**

• **Maritimo v Benfica -- Maritimo +1.0 Asian Handicap - 2.06 (W - 1-1)**

*Lastly, I would not advise putting these all into an acca. As much as I'd like them all to win, it's always unlikely with this many picks so if you do feel you have to combine them in some way please choose a double of your favs or even a treble. Anything more and you're asking for trouble.*

**Bonus Picks: (Odds of Evens or greater)**

• Everton v Burnley -- Draw - 3.80 (L)

• Newcastle v Liverpool -- BTTS &amp; O2.5 goals - 2.00 (L)

• Benevento v Inter Milan -- Inter -3.0 Asian Handicap - 4.40 (L)

• Hertha Berlin or Draw - 3.50 (W)

• Hertha Berlin to Win - 11.00 (small units) [L]

• Heerenveen or Draw - 2.20 (L)

• Maritimo Draw No Bet - 5.50 (P)

The only counter argument I can see is that some people will be tempted to not pay for something when they otherwise would have if say piracy was somehow impossible. I don't think I fall into that camp, and I'm sure there are others, though I would agree that a significant portion likely just pirate everything indiscriminately or get heavily temped/influenced into not purchasing things."

A week ago I told them about how SLS was adding a bunch of skins, fixing their game and getting ready to go ftp so the player base would increase. I tried to hype them up to come back and play for the Halloween event, and then I see this. This is pathetic and will probably turn them off from the game for good, since they were never as into it as me. So disappointed.

Ok, I am 100% behind a WW2 battlefield...but a new engine? 

WHY? Frostbite is literally one of the best engines available right now. It's got some of the most advanced graphical capabilities/features, the optimization is top notch, the netcode is amazing for the amount of features it packs in(64 players, vehicles, bullet ballistics on every weapon). 

There is no reason for a new engine. None at all. Hell, they don't even really need to update what they have. There isn't much left to add...maybe some better DX12 implementation...or Vulkan support?

So you might naively sign up to a course in the US and take on a lot of debt expecting that when you graduate you'll be able to pay it off by getting a job with an employer eager to hire someone with your skills. Universities are somewhat to blame here because they market themselves and tell every kid to get a degree when it's not the right thing for that kid. I lived in Sweden for a while and over there tertiary education is free, which makes retraining so much easier if the industry you are in collapses.

The problem with this though, is that since there were balance changes the meta is still changing so if the deck you chose gets countered or if it preyed on a weaker deck that disappears, you might find yourself with a not so great deck so you should wait a bit.

Saying that I liked something is not worshipping it. I can see flaws in Discovery's first two episodes, just like I can in all of Trek - yes, including ""classic"" episodes.

Acknowledging that it can be interesting to see how principles are maintained in conflict is not preferring conflict like Krall.

Perhaps you should take some other lessons from TOS, like tolerance and IDIC. People are entitled to prefer different things and have different impressions than you.

Incidentally, you should watch Errand of Mercy again. People do die in it - namely the crew of a Klingon ship which is blown up by the Enterprise at the beginning. That loss of life doesn't even prompt a mention or a moment's regret.

Also, if you acknowledge that the Federation and Klingons required a lesson from superior beings to not go to war, then surely it stands to reason that conflict is far more likely before that lesson."

0	snootysnob		sydney6	Sydney Swans	"&gt; Playing at the MCG clearly has a set of challenges that some non-Melbourne clubs deal with better than others

The whole point of this thread is, should interstate teams have to face these challenges every single year when Melbourne clubs don't.  The question is easily answered.  Where do you think Richmond would have preferred to have played yesterday, and why?  Answer that and you see why it's unfair for interstate clubs to play for a flag against home teams, every damn year.  If playing at the MCG is only a 'challenge' to overcome am sure Richmond would have happily played at the Adelaide Oval, yeah, nah!  

If other finals are determined by ladder position why isn't the Grand Final?  It's a massive advantage for Melbourne clubs.

0	shyggy				Buy lots of chest locaters and grab any chest you come across. Titan is the most efficient planet for tokens IMO. Usually i will run around doing public events and killing all the high priorities that i can possibly find. There are also things called scavengers that spawn every once in a while where you kill 2 servitors and get a chest. Not only that but you can also find whatever the planet resource is for that planet and get it when possible (like on Nessus it would be the datalattice). But id say that the best tip I can give is buy lots of those chest locaters from cayde definitely. Chests give 1 token for almost no effort as opposed to public events giving 1 for ~3 or 4 minutes of your time.

He's a grown man, and he can make his own decisions re: staying with someone who may be moving soon. He sounds amazing, and you will kick yourself if you let him go so easily. Trust me [23F] on this. 

More importantly, don't label yourself as a ""failure"" this early in life! College is hard, and if you're truly struggling with your major specific courses, talk it out with your advisor and the professors of your courses. They will be able to tell you honestly if you're up to snuff, and getting to know the teachers will almost always help you if you're teetering between passing and failing. Plus, they can tell you what/how to study, since they're the ones making the tests! Not forging relationships with my professors is my #1 regret from college."

Smooth and soft feeling with the magnetic click. Corner cutting is great and no pops or corner twists. Also, there’s no locking or catching. None. It’s amazing. I’ve gotten consistent sub-16s with this, it’s *so good.*"	True	0	1506816138		0	0	dnqingw	True	t3_73iftb	t3_73iftb	/r/Cubers/comments/73iftb/got_my_sm_today/dnqingw/	1509189662	7	False	Cubers	t5_2r6a3

No. Any races you bought for TWH1 rolls over. In a few weeks, an update/free DLC is being released that lets you have on giant campaign of all races, and the first games campaign in the TWH2 if you own the first game. That means all the first game's races, and the races you bought as DLC,  will be available on TWH2."

0	BananaTotem		eleven	11 Paul Seedsman	"Atkins is good, but he just isn't consistent enough and struggles in tight contests. He's a Vic, so use him to trade for Gibbs. There's a young lad from Sturt by the name of Mitch Crowden that'll take Atkins' wing roll nicely. This guy goes in insanely hard, and makes all the way up to 4th and 5th efforts for the ball. Get him. 

If Lever wants to go be with family in Melbourne, that's completely understandable. For some people, being near family is important, and unfortunately that means his time in Adelaide is done. No hard feelings. Feel the same about it as Dangerfield leaving. All good. Catchya later Jakey boy. Keath can slot in there nicely for ya. Build up Doedee as well. 

Cameron will stay. Simple.

Of course get Jackson Edwards in. The more Father-son picks the better. Not much risk of them leaving. 

Defense is going to be crippled without Smithers, but Seedsman, with a bit of coaching and a good pre-season, can fill his shoes pretty well. 

Crouch bros are going to go absolutely apeshit next year in the midfield. We'll probably have the best midfield in he comp if we get Gibbs, as well as training up Greenwood some more, and of course we have Sloane and Sauce. 

Something needs to be done with JJ, he does not have the same game plan in his head than the rest of the team. "	True	0	1506816141		0	0	dnqiniq	False	t3_73i7xt	t3_73i7xt	/r/adelaidefc/comments/73i7xt/changes_for_2018_thread/dnqiniq/	1509189664	12	False	adelaidefc	t5_2v92s

1) NDP vs Harper (regret, I voted for legalized weed and non-intervention in the ME)
2) Conservatives provincially (they won but it was a girl who cucked out and I regret not voting WR)
3) Libertarian federally because I was butthurt over how shitty the Conservatives were doing in my province, this is the election Trudeau got in and I would definitely just bite my tongue and vote Harper if I could go back
4) Alberta party. Still pissed at our Conservative party and they were doing some random BS so I basically threw away my vote. Should have voted WR again.

I'm pretty happy about where the UCP and federal conservatives are right now, more hopeful than I've ever been for politicians since I've taken the red pill suppository from /pol/ way back when. Also seeing just how shitty Liberals and NDP can be first hand I'll probably just strategically vote against those two for the rest of my life, no matter how ZOG infested or whatever the Conservative party is.

0	JordanFloyd97				"What you call judging, I call making an educated guess on modern gaming trends and logic. EA is replacing a 50 dollar season pass with star cards that give you statistical advantages. How do you get people to buy those star cards? By giving them substantial advantages. Which you posted above would indeed allow you to compete, star cards shouldn't be that good that you cannot compete. You're paying money, to be better at a game. That's the exact definition of paytowin. I'm asking EA to remove the statistical advantage from crates and make them strictly unlocks. EA can continue the franchise by making money off of cosmetics. EA has more money than any of us would ever spend in a lifetime. COD games had unlock based progression for a long time before supply drops and no one complains then. You will be just fine earning your progress instead of buying it, you will live. The game won't die because people have to earn their progress. Stop being dramatic. 

And because I'm asking for a game that's fair dosent mean that I'm jealous if someone has a Ferrari and I don't lol. You're being very dramatic and I'm getting vibes that YOU are offended by this conversation, which is pretty immature. I'm asking for a video game to have an even playing field not for EA to build a rocket ship. Cosmetic only microtransactions isn't something crazy to ask for. 

And a few more things, fighting RNG bullshit crates dosent make something challenging, It's completely random and has no pride or reflects hard work. It's all based on how lucky you are or how much money you spend. As someone from the older generation I'd expect you to understand that. Hard work = nice things not throwing money at the screen. If you actually read my posts you would know that I wasn't asking for things to be handed to me. I work, go to school, sleep, repeat. I don't have much time to play either. But that doesn't mean I would rather have the ability to pay to be good at the game. 

And you owning a business shows your bias to shitty business practices. The way you talk it wouldnt suprise me if you told your employees to repair cars and then sell blinker fluid or elbow grease to people that didn't know better.

What do you mean by animals not technically being people? Do you mean like them not having rights? There are plenty of people, myself included, who do think many non-human animals have rights and should not be factory farmed.

Now, that's the *really* difficult question to ask. I wish I had an answer for you. My hope is that, as the movement grows, vegans will be able to really move things both on an economical and a political level. When the destructive animal industry is reduced and we through political measures reduce (but hopefully fucking **end**) the exploitation of third world countries by the west, these people will over time recover and finally be given the opportunity and *room* to grow. As an individual though all I can do is talk to as many people as possible and make choices that support my beliefs, by buying fair trade products, giving to reliable charities, etc.

0	GaaraDragneel				I use to love chowder! The colors always amazed me before I started smoking weed, but watching it stoned is amazing. I wonder why they ever cancelled it 🤷🏽 ): also loved Flapjack. It also ended way too soon. And it's cool that you recommended anime, I love anime so I've seen most of the main stream stuff currently, but anime is where I really love the drama. The drama feels so real, and you get so connected with the MC and other characters that you really feel like you're side by side with them. Japan is amazing with what they create. When I was really depressed, that's when I got into anime after finally deciding to watch anohana, then Charlotte, kids on the slope, orange. Holy shit man I was feeling all the emotions. Now, especially after naruto ended, where a  lot of my childhood was still clinging to, I just can't find much. I try to stay with the new animes but I've been in a rut since like....february. if you haven't tho, you should check out Kids on the Slope.

It's not really proper hard sci-fi, but more space opera that does this.  

I'd love to see a novel that tackles actual space colonization.  It would probably involve very fast spacecraft that use hibernation.  The nearest potentially habitable planets are within a few dozen lightyears away from us, *however*, space travel probably won't be near light speed, so it may take many millennia to travel to the nearest one.  37,000 years to go one light year using a space shuttle.

Far too many adventures are quivering 10 page masses unusable bland elements tied into some would be novelist's derivative fantasy story buttressed by a swarm of cliched NPCs with too much backstory, but a lack of memorable detail or compelling reasons to be of interest to anyone but the writer.

Sept.28, 1918- the day Adolf Hitler was spared-&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Tandey#Hitler_incident

Any of the times Alexander the Great could have died much earlier-&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLABw0f4Ais

overcame ridiculous odds to barely squeak out a victory -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia

August 18, 1227- Genghis Khan dies

And plenty more.  Imagine how much history would have changed if any of these people died earlier, or lived longer.

Which really means ""Welcome all fat people, we don't care that you're fat, and there will probably be other fat people around"" but they probably wouldn't make as much money if they said that.

As the victim of the joke, it's good to learn to laugh it off and not take it seriously (Tyrion's quote comes to mind). It's more power to you. But at the same time, the victim of the joke has every right to be upset as well since it *is* a joke at their expense. 

I'm all about being responsible of our emotions and whatever, but people should be responsible of the shit they say to others as well. Don't just blame the small dick person for not handling it well. It's really just victim blaming and that's not fun. It's a low tier of victim blaming but doesn't change the fact that it is.

If the person with the small dick gets upset, sure he can learn to handle it better, but the person who made the small dick joke should've also known not everyone is going to take it well."

However, she chose to brutalize every Doman for what happened to her, probably including those who suffered similar injustices.  There should be no redemption for her.

Everyone likes to discuss Fordola and explain her actions away as well but the crux of the matter is not that she was an Ala Mighan that turned traitor to Ala Migho, but rather that she chose to participate in the atrocities committed by the Garlean Empire.  I have no issue with her seeing herself as a Garlean, I only have issue with what she did as a Garlean.  There is no excuse for the things she was doing to civilians in the name of the Empire.  

Zenos was just too crazy to let live.

All too often people try to empathize with the villain and excuse their actions on the basis of the fact that they suffered in the past. The truth is that there is a lot of suffering going around and yet most people don't decide to murder or abuse others and use their own suffering as an excuse to do so.

Trouble is, a bunch of times, these same people don't want to learn as much as they just want to hear what they want to hear, or they just want to be spoon-fed the answers on demand. I want to see people think for themselves, put a little elbow grease of their own into it, and if they're stuck on a legitimate question, that's fine. But if it's super basic stuff? I mean, I can play the ""Why?"" game all day with a toddler without losing my shit on them, but a grown-up is another matter entirely.

0	Narvarre				"We saw literally 10-15 seconds of them post-reveal. of courses there is going to be massive social and political unrest, an entire form of government has lost it majority power in an instance.

 A government that presides over the bulk of a people that have been raised to believe that murder in the streets is perfectly justified.


Look at it from the point of view of the people, its a society where this has never happened, any hint of their origins and the truth of where they are has been long since lost to time. Fact become stories, stories become wives tales, becomes myths and legends, before fading completly from the collective racial history of an entire race. 

Down through the generations it goes, every generation a little more is lost as those who knew the truth are unable to pass on the information to their children because of death/disease etc till nothing is left.


You look up to see the sky, something that has remained fixed point through all of living memory. And all of a sudden its gone. It would be of a scale like us on earth waking up one morning to find something insane like another planet stretching from horizon to horizon above us.
No way in hell an entire people are just gonna go """"meh, nothing to see here"""" 

There is no way in hell that the peoples transition to a space faring race again is gonna be easy or smooth at all. Union is gonna have a really hard time convincing most of the people of the truth, hell. for many it may be that anyone from the Union will be seen as a demon who stole the sky.

It seems like a good buy, but I just don't like certain things about it. Namely, the power supply and RAM speed.

If it normally is $1300, it's a good deal and you should take it. If not, then you should build it on your own and add faster RAM. Ryzen performs significantly better with just the jump to 2666MHz and even better with faster RAM (only without as much of a significant boost). The power supply is also cutting it close. If you plan to overclock at any time in the future and since you are going to be streaming, it's going to be under heavy load for long periods of time. Having a 500W power supply without even knowing the efficiency rating is scary to me."

     When I'm tying knots, or a simple noose in particular, I notice that there seems to be some ""bends"" or points in the rope that want to bend in a certain direction because it isn't straight. This is what I think you mean by angle. Now this doesn't seem to buckle the knot when using my boot, but the diameter, size, hardness etc. of the wood plank/cylindrical wood plank exploits that in the knot causing it to buckle and lose its integrity. If I'm correct, making absolutely sure that the rope is ""straight"" when finishing the knot should make the noose/or any other knot a lot stronger. Is this correct?"

Basically whatever makes you happy and doesn't squick you out. Again, you *should* be fine. And if you're not, well, you'll be like me on this sub, advising caution but understanding the nonchalance.

The chicken I would keep for a week without blinking.

Reheating 4 hours in advance is a terrible idea no matter how you slice it - food should stay in the ""danger zone"" of room temp for no more than 2 hours. If it was anything other than rice, which is one of the leading causes of food poisoning in the US, I think you would be fine. But for a bacteria friendly rice dish... Bad plan.

The only thing i would honestly and safely say is that no one has reported that their respective store got less SNES on day one than they did NES, so it is safe to assume  that stock for day one exceeds the one NES Classic got last year.

0	nayuun_art				"...This is embarrassing to know you came from r/fireemblem, I didn't think people would look through my post history and find me being a simpering fool because my illness got a stranglehold of me last night.

Well, now that you're here and while I debate if I want to keep this up or not... might as well reply.

I get what you're saying and I do agree. It's just that to us Borderlines, having a ""favorite person"" means more than it entails. To us with BPD, having an ""FP"" as we call them is... how do I put this? Basically, the FP is the most important person in our lives. We ignore their shortcomings and we're so starved for attention and affection we don't care if this FP is a bad person at all. Unfortunately, an ex friend of mine was an FP years ago and while they were, I had realized they were bad for me and I had to pull myself away as hard as it was. Till now, they're still angry I did it despite the fact I don't talk to them anymore. Losing an FP is black and white for us: if we lose them, that means they're a shitty person and how dare they fool us? While we're in the ""honeymoon"" phase, we legit think our FPs are capable of doing no wrong.

To put it in simple terms: we put them on a pedestal which proves to be detrimental to both us and our FP. 

Now, I know what you're thinking: if having an FP is so bad, why do we do it anyways? Why do we want to be someone's favorite too, in that case? For that, I have no clear answer. The best I can come up with is that we just want to be as important to someone else too. It isn't fair to us, in our minds, that we have people we idolize and would do anything for only for that person not to feel the same way. It makes us feel attention-starved more and it makes us feel we're not worthy of anyone's time.

It's fucked up thinking, I know, but we're Borderlines after all. Everyone on this sub is a Borderline and we understand each other which is why we all rant to each other here, because even our therapists are sick of our shit.

I went off on a tangent there.

Unfortunately, when we have an ""FP"", we become very clingy, very dependent, and... it's really a toxic relationship. At least for the people who don't want to be our FPs. Some people understand the way our stupid brains work while others are quick to block us or ghost us and call us hideous names for something we cannot control for the life of us.

You have points, you do, and I acknowledge you are right. Buying gifts and such is no way to make friends, and I acknowledge this. You are also right that I do not trust ""Person A"" in this hypothetical situation. To be frank, even though I have friends who care about me, there is always a doubt lurking in the back of my mind that they are actually Person C in this situation. This is because I, like a large majority of this sub, have been abandoned and used like we're nothing.

I apologize for this massive wall of text. There are days I'm better at controlling my BPD, and there are days when I cannot control it no matter how much I try. While I know it's silly to hope I could be someone's ""FP"", a part of me does continue to hope for it. It's just the way my brain is wired, I guess."

However, if you are playing ER on a solid stock that can't go down very much and even if it does, you don't mind owning the stock at the lower price, then writing out of the money put options can be one of the best ways imo to profit from ER especially when most of the time stocks tend to go up on ER.

0	BurntPaper				"Is it really that unreasonable that someone could have internet access? Is the entire communication network down completely? Even if it is, there's still satellite internet and solar phone chargers and generators. I'd imagine in a situation like that, if someone has a satellite internet plan, they'd probably let other people use it to get messages to the outside world. 

I don't even find this post very farfetched. We know there's aid going over there. Whether or not it's sufficient is another issue alltogether, but I don't see how this is automatically assumed to be a lie. 

The only things that stick out to me are the holocaust thing, and the FBI. The holocaust thing, I can't say much about, since I haven't seen any quotes on this and I'm not as up to date on the situation as some. As for the FBI, they could be there to help with planning or coordination, or some other support or advisory role. Or it could just be volunteers that just happen to be FBI, and wear their FBI branded stuff for identification or to establish authority. Or the guy could just be mistaken. 

I'm not saying this is legit, of course. Just saying that it's not farfetched, and I don't know why it's being labeled an outright lie right off the bat.

This probably isn't very profound, but I was thinking about a bible school song, ""be careful little eyes what you see."" Advertising works because the more you see something the more your brain likes it. Familiarity. It also works with music, if you're not used to a certain type, it's hard to listen to, but repetition can fix it. If we know something to be abhorrent we shouldn't interact because it will find it's way in. Something like that.

0	notts001				I read one analysis that said that the no generation was the same group of individuals in 1973 and 2017. The difference is as they were older they had a higher turnout in 2017. Given how pro EU the younger generation is its probably only a few years before the country gains a majority in favour of remaining within the EU, at least until a new generation comes along with a different attitude. So actually it was probably the worst time to have the referendum. If Cameron had left it longer he could have won and his legacy would not be in tatters.

0	FrozenFractalsofIce				So I have a long term success story. My mother has borderline personality disorder and spent my entire childhood vacillating between the extremes of every emotion, within a short time frame. It was horrible because I never knew what to expect and had to be constantly on guard. She would go from praising my intelligence to telling me I was a desperate whore worth nothing all while making me feel responsible for her emotions. She essentially gaslighted me my entire life and I still struggle with feeling confident in my own memories. There was other stuff too, sexual abuse at home but I have very few memories of that, thankfully, since what I do have is bad enough. Thanks to this I had horrible coping mechanisms. I have no idea how my husband put up with me for the first couple years. Eventually, I managed to escape my childhood horrors and realized I needed help because I wasn't ok and I wanted to be the best version of myself possible for my own daughter. So, I found a therapist I was comfortable with and put in the time and work to learn how to process what I lived through and cultivating positive coping mechanisms in addition to finding a combination of medicines to help me remain stable instead of teetering into depression and the more obsessive, controlling tendencies I get when stressed. It took several years to get to where I am now but I'm finally happy, steady, and comfortable with/proud of who I am. I even managed to forgive my mother for how she treated me. I know she has a problem and is miserable so I can understand WHY she does things but I will never have a relationship with her. I just refused to allow her to have any impact on my life anymore because she stole enough from me already, I'm not going to allow her to do it now that she's out of my life. Being angry and resentful wasn't hurting her at all (in fact, that allows her to be the victim, which she loves) but it was eating me up so I decided to let it go. Now I have a strong, successful marriage (12 years and still going strong), I'm a great mother, and have a career that allows me to support my family. I feel like I'm finally the person I was always meant to be and I love this version of me.

Can you detail out your experiences with ""publishing?"" I see a lot of comments in awe of this, frankly, trivial thing.

I know of many YA authors who have agents and publishers that will not touch anyone who is self-published, and contractually require them to abstain from doing so. If something was already self-published, it will never be picked up for major publication. Maybe in the early days where that was still an interesting rags to riches story, but I was surprised to find how vilified that process is when to me it sounds like the definition of proactivity.

I am assuming that you've essentially self-published your novel, and did not go through Big Publishing to do it, else you wouldn't be running your own AMA and would be linking to / referring to your publishers as required by contract.

Further, you spoke about carrying the novel ""through editing."" Did you self-edit, or have an editor review? Especially with YA, an editor's role is aligned completely with a publisher because they will edit the story to increase target audience stickiness + product potential, so it isn't merely proofreading.

Any marketing or ad budget (besides word-of-mouth social like this AMA)?

Did you consult anyone regarding these issues? Were you aware of them? 

Or did you simply DIY the whole thing?

I'm interested to know as again the aspiring writers I work with all seem to have the same issue of self-publishing leading to success being a fairy tale pushed by those interested to profit from mass amounts of self-publishing, and for NYT bestseller levels you will either not find or see a cover-up regarding their self-publishing days.

I mean the US was the last vestige for people fleeing their country, legally or illegally.
Also considering US is now the 4th Rome.
And the US is definintly part or at the forefront of the globalist agenda.

The industry has changed a lot in recent years. Self-publishing is becoming bigger for first time authors as it is becoming harder and harder to traditionally publish with the decline of sales for physical books. I've found through going to conferences and asking publishers and agents specifically about this issue that many are changing their views to pick up authors whose self-published work sells well. All that said, I also may never go traditional. I enjoy having control over my novel and final say on everything regarding it. That's just my opinion. However, I believe that if I chose to go the traditional route with a publishing house that I wouldn't have an issue finding a publisher to pick up my novel if it sells well. 

As for editing I had a professional editor that I worked with for a year and a half on making sure this manuscript was the best it could be. Not all editors are aligned with publishers these days, and the editing the story to cater to a crowd is the opposite of what I wanted. Writing is my passion, I'm not in it for the money, and I'm going to stay true to my writing and my stories.

As for marketing I am fortunate enough to know a world-class marketer who is helping me market my novel. 

I consulted a lot of people and have been to several writing conferences where I have been able to ask the professionals these question so I did not go into this process blind. I was well informed about the flaws and issues that come with this process. 

The world of writing is ever changing and I believe in what I'm doing and how I'm doing it. I'm not in it for the money. I write because it's my passion- everything else is a bonus.

So for the most part I will leave it to you to research it if your interested. However I will get you started by directing you to the very first sentence of the David Belle page of wikipedia.

You did well to hire and editor and seek the help of that marketer, but you should definitely be prepared for an uphill battle.  That marketer is going to be your best friend, so definitely seek their advice as this continues.

I just wanted to let you know, from someone who self-published eight books and is currently trying to sneak into traditional publishing, that writing and releasing the book is much, much easier than the rest of the process.  Keep a strong hand on your social media, post every day, but mostly don't assume people will want to read your book or automatically respect you for self-publishing.  

In fact, it's the opposite.  Readers want any chance to be distracted away from your work, and it's up to you to make them care enough about you to read your book.  Writing YA makes that easier because you have a larger base that's easier to manage, but keeping up with your platform is still going to be the toughest part of your job.

That said, this AMA has (relatively) exploded, so I wish you the best of luck and that your head is always full of stories."

0	Http-Isaac				"All of our crews drive vans, IMO vans are the best all rounders and definitely the best option (for crews and field techs.) 

For Crews: You can fit your whole crew, compressor, all your hoses and guns, shovels, loader motor, and anything else you need for a job and know that everything is going to be dry and and safe inside the van. For ladders: I’ve never seen a van you couldn’t put a ladder rack on. For shingles: All our crews have trailers, but sometimes on smaller jobs (10 sqs. or less) they will just load all the material into the van itself.

For Field Techs: You can fit in all your repair/estimating equipment easily and still have plenty of room for enough material for a full day of repairs. Also if you are a field tech who also does a lot of your own paperwork, a couple of our guys have desks in the back of their van and will often do estimates, invoices, etc. on site and print them to hand directly to the customer instead of relying on email or USPS. Only one of our guys has a ladder rack since he often uses a two story ladder, but everyone else uses Telestep Ladders so they can keep their ladders in the van and not having a ladder rack is a boost to MPG."

I've never used a case on any of my phones (4/5/6/SE), and only dropped them only a handful of times between them. Never broken a screen. 

I wonder if cases have some sort of ""indestructible"" effect on their handling. Like, if it's in a big ass case you are physcologically  more likely to be more careless. Whereas when it's naked you are more careful. 

Also, I am comfortable with paying to replace the screen if and when I do break one. At this point buying a new screen once in 5-6 years is cheaper than all the different cases I would have had to buy over the same time period.

My guess is that it has to do with the lack of tension that you're placing on yourself in the form of sexual excitement. You're spending less time fapping, which itself requires one to constantly apply stimulation to themselves.

Sexual tension is still a form of tension, so through tempering that, you're not as strung out as you otherwise would be. Things feel ""slower."""

Either way, every time I run `pacman -Syu`, I get the errors listed above, which is a bit concerning. Xmonad seems to be running alright, but I've noticed some minor bugs lately. For example, my xmobar will disappear a few times a day, and I have to run `xmonad --restart` to bring it back. Also, I'll occasionally lose focus on a window, which i can work around by focusing on another window and focusing back on my original window.

You would brand me ""gullible"" without even taking the time to understand my view (which you haven't shown any curiosity towards at all), because all that matters to you is that you sense I might disagree with your pet theory.

Switches and buttons don't always (or even usually) make contact smoothly, it's normal to include a circuit that smoothes out the output to eliminate switch bouncing.

&gt; The encoder comes on a board already with what look like resistors on. 

Okay, if you're using a pre-assembled board with an encoder on it then odds are it already includes a debouncing circuit. If you see some capacitors on the module, then it's a safe bet that it does.

Casting diversity: Miranda said that the portrayal of Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and other white historical figures by black and Hispanic actors should not require any substantial suspension of disbelief by audience members. ""Our cast looks like America looks now, and that's certainly intentional"", he said. ""It's a way of pulling you into the story and allowing you to leave whatever cultural baggage you have about the founding fathers at the door."" He noted ""We're telling the story of old, dead white men but we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.""

The pro-immigration message of Hamilton is at the forefront, as the show revolves around the life of one of the Founding Fathers of America, Alexander Hamilton, and how he made his mark in American politics as an immigrant. Instead of being characterized as a white person, Alexander Hamilton's immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show, alongside with the virtue and prowess of Hamilton (""by working a lot harder, by being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter,"" described in the show's opening), in order to foster a positive image of immigrants. Alongside this, the casting of Black, Latino, and Asian American leads allowed audiences to literally view America as a nation of immigrants, with the intention of showing how irrelevant the Founding Fathers' whiteness is to their claim on the country. ""Hamilton is a story about America, and the most beautiful thing about it is... it's told by such a diverse cast with a such diverse styles of music,"" according to Renee Elise Goldberry, who played Angelica Schuyler. ""We have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us don't necessarily think is our own."" Miranda has stated that he is ""totally open"" to women playing the Founding Fathers. Casting for the British production is expected to feature predominantly black British artists."

Like, I consider myself a kinda genderqueer/gender non-conforming male. I like the idea of being able to express myself more femininely though.

I get that burning bridges might need to happen, or at least letting the bridges stop being used. My biggest thing isn't necessarily being able to express myself around people I know right now, it's about how to not drive myself crazy.

Another thing is, how do I manage to balance the desire of being more open with the idea of maintaining some secrecy? Seems like those ideas are opposites and can't coexist in my mind."

Drain covers are not welded down because they are the access points from there the drainage pipes are cleaned. I used to oversee the set up of the Adelaide track. We would put new bolts in prior to the race weekend. I also noticed yesterday when the track was drying that the asphalt joints are visible down the centre of the track - this tends to indicate that asphalt is starting to fail. Given that this is the last race, i am not suprised that the maintenance of it has been let go.

Also, when Trump says that it ""*should* be a community effort"", that implies that the community is not already putting in effort, that there is no community effort. His critique extends beyond Puerto Rican leaders, to Puerto Rican workers and the Puerto Rican community. The Puerto Rican community is a good synonym for the Puerto Rican people, I think.

Criticizing leadership during a crisis is one thing, but Trump definitely should have left the workers and the community out of his statement."

My dream I've had for what I want to be remembered for is for writing those strong female characters that girls can identify with. I think YA Sci-fi needs more badass female characters without a plot that predominantly follows a love interest. Girls kick ass without men just fine. I want to write characters that people can identify with and really relate to. 
My storyline was actually inspired by an adventure I had with my friend one day. We were playing make believe when I was younger (it had to do with dragons) and we looked up in the sky and saw this bright ball of light (that wasn't the sun) that dissipated after a minute. So, naturally, we incorporated that into our game as the portal to the dragon world. Thinking back on this incident years later as I was walking through the same woods we were playing in that day got me thinking and from that came this book!"

0	FFpain		blue brackets	Calvinist	"This is a classic case of idolatry. The God you have in your mind is not the God of the Bible.

We tend to box God up by His characteristics. Some people think only on God's love. Others, His wisdom. Even others, His justice. Even others, His benevolence.

This is wrong to do. God is not just a being of infinite love. He is also a being of infinite hate towards evil. He is a being of justice. You can not separate God by one or two of His attributes. Just like you would not like people to misrepresent by only defining you by your hair color. 

So the question is, what is a good and just God supposed to do with an evil people like us?

You will say, ""Yeah, but why hell for ETERNITY? Why not temporal judgement. I am, after all, a finite being.""

This is a question asked only by those with a small view of God and His holiness. An allegory would be to liken your crime of hitting me in public. What would happen to you? You might get arrested for a small bit. You might even get away with it depending on where we were at or who had seen it.

But if you had struck the President of the United States, how much greater would be your crime? How much greater the punishment? Why? Because the position of authority you just offended is much greater than mine.

In the same way, God's justice is infinite because His position of authority is infinite. Our crimes against Him are infinite.

Good news is, He is also a God of infinite love, (remember?) And Jesus substituted/represented on the cross all who would believe in Him and receive grace and forgiveness, for He suffered our judgement on our behalf.

Those who will not receive grace, but in their stubbornness continue to love their life of sin instead of turning to Christ; God is a God of justice."

Normally within 2 weeks it’s starts rearing it’s head. Some people are better at it though and it takes a bit longer. That’s where experience starts throwing up those red flags that help you recognize you have a problem employee on your hands sooner rather than later.

As a side note I really respect when an interviewee doesn’t speak negatively about their former employer. Bashing a former employer and their business as a reason you are looking for a new job makes what should be a positive conversation the opposite and makes me feel that can be me one day.

That kid would pop you straight in the mouth and run you over for being like 5 foot 6 or however tall he was. I'm pretty sure Tiki and Jacobs were thunder and lightning and then when Bradshaw took over with Jacobs I was referring to them as the volume 2 version. Now though, I'm not so sure either.

So I actually started my first draft on a type-writer that my grandmother had given me. When I was transferring it from there to word I realized that the story sucked, so I pulled out the pieces I liked and threw away what I didn't. What I was left with was the first half of the plot, and my main characters. From there I reshaped it, and rewrote about 75% of it. I didn't like the other one as much, and the ending wasn't true to the book. It wasn't too hard because it was never a job to me- I've always loved the story and the world I got to play in when writing it. For me it wasn't work so I didn't see the set-back in scrapping everything."

A common trend among their killings is they don't bother killing anyone personally. They simply make people take their own lives. Police are run by the Yakuza too.
They are just incredibly smart gangsters.

My suggestion:

A. Allow it to attack coastal cities with the garrison, after a victory you can only sack or raze, you can’t occupy. Keep the recruitment to 1 per turn and add a raiding stance. Take away the replenishment bonus 

B. Take away the garrison but add the ability to garrison a lord and their army, keep the replenishment bonus so that the lords army can function for a long period of time. Make it so that without a army the Arks are sitting ducks.

Whatever CA decides to do I hope a mod can give us options. Or maybe a early tech which helps you decide what kind of ark you can recruit, raiding or support.

0	PatchytheYoukai				"Also, you might want reduce the number of your little reproduction time with your partner. Of course it's better if you just cut it off until you two gets married, I will tell you why.

Traditional Chinese doctors value the existence of the life essence, which are anti-matter substance in our bodies. They are very,very important, as it is one of the basic components of your life! (It's funnny that Western doctors don't believe those simply because they could not detect it yet. ) 

When you carry out the process of reproduction, you give out your life essence (yin for girls) so it can be matched with the other half (yang for boys) to form a baby, along with sperm and eggs.  The more you do it for purpose outside of having children, the more life essence you waste.

And what happens when you waste too much of it? Well, you will age prematurely! (That's one reason why Western people ages earlier than Eastern people, since the culture in the East are more conservative than the West) And what's more, it will make you feel like a hollow stump without energy, and all problems and weird diseases can occur everywhere in your body, since the immunity system can't get their share of life essence, and therefore unable to make enough white blood cells to fight viruses and other invaders.

Anyway, it's definitely not worth it to do it so many times. And trust me, you will have a far better life quality when you reduce your number of reproduction and masturbation, since you will have more time to help others and the society, which are the reasons why do we even exist"	True	0	1506816193		0	0	dnqiot4	False	t3_71k7j6	t1_dnqi2dd	/r/NoFapWomen/comments/71k7j6/day_one_single_woman/dnqiot4/	1509189683	2	False	NoFapWomen	t5_2zkpn

Hi there! Thanks for doing an AMA.

I assume you're a reader, not just a writer--how did you get into reading? Who are some of your favorite authors? How did you decide to go with intergalactic adventures, as opposed to...literally any other genre?  Do your many animal companions play a role in this novel? Also, how do you feel about onions?

Starting off with the most important question: the original because the humour was so on point and the characters felt more real than whatever Teen Titans Go! Has going on right now. I adore the one I grew up with. 

Yes! I've always been a reader. I remember learning to read with my dad specifically when I was younger and his mother was an English teacher so she fostered the love of reading in me as a child. I attribute my love of literature and writing to her. She passed away two years ago this month and I miss her everyday. 

Favorite authors are Ray Bradbury, J.K. Rowling, Jane Austen, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. 

To be honest I adore classics. My dad bought be a bunch for Christmas when I was 12 and I've been hooked ever since. I started writing about intergalactic travels though because I wanted to write worlds where I'm not bound by traditional rules that we have here on Earth. I wanted limitless possibilities and adventure.

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them ""imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.""
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

Its the ""lob the ball if your teammate isn't going forward, wait for the opponent to reach the net before challenging, and miss open nets after flipping the wrong way"" what I think you're saying is, don't trust them to make wall hits, be in position for passes, challenge, and make accurate shots.

No one asked for, or needs, my support to be guaranteed their first amendment right. 

That's because I'm just some guy, I'm not the government. 

Did you really think that I'm the government?  

You do not have the right to physically harm me, and that is why the government may punish you for doing so. 

The government may not punish you for saying I deserve to be punched in the face, even though I don't support that idea.   

If I see a klan march in my town, I might hurl a piss bottle so I understand where you're coming from. They have the right to march but I find it so threatening and abhorrent that I might do something illegal and probably unreasonable. 

As a matter of fact I went to the Boston rally with the intention of starting a fight. Thankfully there were 40,000 people there much smarter than me who handled it in a better way.   

I don't personally think it's appropriate to burn the flag, but nobody asked me and my opinion doesn't have any impact whatsoever on the legality of it.

So even though Shapeshift has very high fees, it would be the easiest option for Dash (FOR THIS GROUP) due to the re-usable addresses.  We would have them set up the auto-buy and auto-sell ONCE on Coinbase, and then send to the re-usable address FOREVER.  This is very convenient for non-technical users. They would basically set it and forget it.   This is not possible on Poloniex, Bittrex, or Kraken.  The more times these user are forced to log on, the more chance there is of catastrophe.

In some subreddits, a removal reason will only be left in a flair. This flair is on the right or left of the title of your post.

I would say the worst part of 81 is the vendors are always trying to bring stuff not on mod , and moving tags If you don't watch them.  Problem is they come in earlier than you.
One of them told me that it didn't make sense the way the mod was laid out. I told him that I don't care if it makes sense or not that it is my job to make sure that it is the way that they want it.

also (and this is key), harriers count on dealing their damage as...discreetly as possible.  if you challenge and pursue them directly (unless you're a medic), the fact that they're so woefully outgunned instantly transforms them from predators into prey.  so, yeah, realizing how weak their gun is is significant, because you might find more success challenging them directly rather than trying to flee.

I'm reminded of how Freddy Mercury -- whose teeth were famously awful -- refused to get them fixed despite being able to afford it because he worried it would hurt his singing voice. Based on those SSA clips I just heard, I think Su has proved him wrong (albeit 25 years after his death). If anything, she sounds a little better than she did compared to last year pre-surgery.

The big thing is that it didn't feel optional because by the time you get to that point you've already played the game three times and the fourth is your final 'finish the game' run. Because until you do that you haven't actually finished the game. It even dumps you directly into Inferno when you talk to the characters after killing Diablo the same way that after killing Malachai it would open a portal to Cruel/Merciless. But Inferno was, from the first moment, ludicrously hard to the point where grinding white mobs for trash drops for weeks until you could kill skeleton king, to grind him for weeks to try and get strong enough for the next boss, etc, was completely normal. The final difficulty didn't feel optional any more than Nightmare/Hell did. Comparatively, Uber Atziri is very clearly super hard mode, since to get to her you have to grind regular Atziri a lot, and the game doesn't push that you're 'supposed to' fight her."

0	coach_jesus				"1. I would generally advise against programs like Smolov. While anecdotally a lot of people claim it does them some good you're better off finding something more sustainable. Smolov is more likely to break you than make you stronger in the long run. Maybe try an appropriate Sheiko program.

2. Bench responds well to frequency and GPP, especially for newer lifters. Try to bench 3 days per week and include some variants in there too - dips, push ups, incline, close grip, db press, etc. Even just general bodybuilding work for your upper body will be helpful. Just make sure you're doing enough rowing, curling and rear delt work to keep things like your elbows and shoulders happy.

3. Absolutely compete! If you can lift the bar and the collars to the legal standard of your chosen federation then get on in there. Powerlifters are a very supportive bunch. Don't make the mistake of waiting until you're ""competitive"". Meets are a great way to expose you to the sport, put some external pressure on your training and develop the competition skills required to help you perform when you are competitive. If you can't find any PL clubs in your area try checking online for PL feds in your country. You should be able to sign up there.

0	FetusCommander				"Cube McDravian is a post-human, post-gender, post office clusterfuck situated in the bowels of melkrin's Hell.

Most inhabitants are human, but the post-human Others (a small minority of [hydra-like](http://lifeinfreshwater.net/hydra/) beings) are in control of the somewhat unstable government.  On a good day, the governing body has its shit together enough to project its utopian vision of a world without human forms of identity (race, gender, sexuality, and other things considered to be ""negatory"").

The comic below depicts a typical day in the Cube.  In it, a morality officer dispenses flowers (a rarity) to those humans who obey the strict dress code, and justice to one particular Rich Dude who doesn't.

The claw shown in some of the frames is an implement used by various government entities.  Powered by Isotope-39, a gift from Heaven, it has the power to transform Things into Other Things (it's most commonly used to change humans into Others as a reward for extreme Party loyalty).  It can also do cool stuff like rearrange the city, which is built on a giant Rubik's Cube.

0	confirmSuspicions		rammus		"&gt;Views will go down because nobody will watch bad teams

Actually views have gone down a lot compared to what their previous peaks were.  You have less viewers for a longer amount of time with bo3.  It's not as important that the views might be about the same over time if they are chasing PEAK viewership.

I will watch a game of 2 ""bad"" teams, but I'm not gonna watch a single game in a bo3 with 2 bad teams.  Not everyone has the same viewing habits.  I mean, this gives me time to watch EU now too.

&gt;Cheese strats will hurt good teams

Part of being a good team is being adaptable.  If cheese strats work so well against good teams in bo1, maybe they're not that good?  Imo it's more annoying watching a good team smash a bo3 and helps level the playing field a bit if the ""good teams"" have to also prepare for cheese.

Initiate when:

- enemy team is out of position, ex. Clumped up (easier to be aoed, backline easily deleted since they cant run away fast enough, allows you the tank to cc them)
In low elo, if mage and mm like to be in front/ has shit positioning  attack right away and kill them- easy 5v3
-enemy low health, your team has higher health- usually a good move but must take into factor if your team is bad or good at teamfights because 4 good players can destroy 5 bad teamfighters
- outnumbering, if 2 enemies are at their top and bot lane, gank 5v3 by the time they get there their 3 teammates are dead

- team is higher leveled and more items- good to be agressive here as item/hero stats will give you the advantage 


Also if they are spread out, like 3 at lord and 2 at mid, gank lord side as quickly as possible. By the time their 2 teammates get there, they will suicide and their lord got stolen.

- also make sure if your teammates are following you
If you initiate but your teammates run away (low elo), then you end up dying while teammates call you noob, idiotic tank.

- run away if you feel your team will be wiped out and press retreat

0	Emekasan				"1) It is heavily implied that Alphamon is an agent of Yggdrasil rather than Homeostasis. This is why we have seen Alphamon and Jesmon fight a couple times in *tri.* Alphamon was sent in in *Symbiosis* to stop Jesmon from killing Meicoomon, because Yggdrasil *wants* to use Meicoomon to attack the human world. 

2) Yup! That is correct. 

3) Yes, Taichi was simply running away to avoid being swallowed by the emerging fissure. Omegamon only, apparently, had time to save Taichi or Yamato &amp; Meiko. He couldn't save both. Thus Taichi gave a non verbal ""okay"" to go save Yamato &amp; Meiko instead of himself. Omegamon complied and that's why he dashed off away from Taichi.

4) This doesn't have a clear answer. What is *implied* is that in Hikari's despair at seemingly losing her brother, Yggdrasil possessed her and amplified her negative emotions greatly, which then affected Nyaromon severely and gave her enough *dark* power to dark-warp digivolve into Ophanimon Fall Down Mode. That or Homeostasis possessed her or some other unexplained phenomenon. However its highky suggested that it was Yggdrasil at work.

As to why it fused with Meicoomon, that is also currently unclear. Most likely because both Meicoomon and Ophanimon FM were running the same darkness that may have been provided by Yggdrasil (or some other malevolent force). But honestly, I'm still at a loss myself. 

5) Taichi simply empathized with Meiko. He understood that Meicoomon was pretty far gone and at that point had to be stopped completely to avoid more damage to Earth. Her darkness/corruption/virus/Apocalymon/whatever-you-want-to-call-it had accelerated too much and the only way to save her, and by extent the human world, would be to kill her. That's what Meiko, and later the Chosen Children, accepted. Taichi was simply the first one to explicitly agree with her.

Hey all!Today marks the one year anniversary of our initial release on Steam! To celebrate it, we’ve released a brand new interlude - formerly known as “shorts” - for free! Titled Nal Sidian, this five-page story delves into the vortigaunt Dreyfus’ past, and explores his relationship to the nefarious Combine. Our plan is to release a free interlude between every chapter going forward. Now integrated into the app’s chapter selection menu, these pieces are very much fundamental to the complete story.Speaking of the app, this update also introduces some much needed tweaks and updates! We now have improved language support, and we’ve released Chapter 1 and the first interlude (The Charnel House) for the new languages as well! You can now read through the first section of the comic in Czech, German, Spanish, and Turkish! We will be bringing these languages to Chapters 2, 3, and Nal Sidian in the coming months, as well as continuing to add more languages to our selection. Brazilian Portuguese is next and should be out within a few weeks, with more to come! The translations took us a bit longer to get out the door than we’d have liked, largely because we no longer had the original files for Chapter 1 and had to reletter it, as well as the looming size of Chapter 2. Our original plan was not to release the language updates incrementally, but we feel it’s important for our superb team of volunteer translators to see their work on the page! We’ll be forging ahead with the monster that is Chapter 2, and working towards a point where we’re releasing new chapters simultaneously (or at least nearly simultaneously) across all of our supported languages. The app also now includes integration with our soundtrack, so that you can easily listen to Chris’s ambient tunes while reading. We have a few other features in the pipeline (including controller support) and there will be more updates to come on the app soon as well! What about Chapter 4?We’re well over halfway through production on Chapter 4: A Spy in the House of Long, and we could not be more excited about how it’s coming together. Taking place directly after the Pit debacle, 4 sees Sejal Rajani’s Opposition, Governor Moore and Major-General Long come head-to-head in a dramatic confrontation on the edge of the city, whilst shedding new light on the Citadel and the mysterious being wrapped around it. We have always suffered from being slow storytellers, and we’ve been very aware of that over the last several months. With that in mind, Chapter 4 really digs deep into New Franklin and applies pressure to the different groups competing for power. It’s visually stunning, too. The team - which brings back Kristian, Ivan, Ester and Javier - are operating at the top of their game, and between them have created a gorgeous, moody, almost noir-like atmosphere for what’s shaping up to be the best chapter yet. We’re super excited about it, and can’t wait to share it with you all.What else?The first draft of Chapter 5 is complete, and we’re hoping to push that into production before the end of the year, for an early Spring release. 5 closes the arcs established in Chapter 3, and kicks off a new trajectory for Chapters 6 and 7 in (we think) spectacular fashion! Key word: “Masquerade”. And of course, you can expect a third interlude between Chapters 4 and 5.As many of you no doubt already know, Marc Laidlaw released a veiled synopsis for Half-Life 2: Episode 3 last month. Ross wrote about it in a blog post titled ""Doctor Breen is Dead"". It was oddly cathartic. Keep an eye out for more blog posts in the future.You might also have noticed that Chapters 2 and 3, as well as the soundtrack, are now on sale! In light of the soundtrack integration, now might be a really good time to pick that up if you haven’t already.For now, though, please enjoy Nal Sidian and let us know what you think of both it and the app updates. And of course please let us know of any errors you might come across, there are a lot of changes that took place in our app!Until next time!

Conditioning people to view sex as using an object until orgasm isn't healthy. Conditioning people to see women as a vehicle for sex by making robots as close to human women as possible who serve as sex objects isn't healthy. 

There are already articles out about robots with 'resistance' settings to let men act out their rape fantasies.

&gt;How? Again, it's a robot

A robot that is made to replicate a human woman. They broke her fingers and left her completely soiled. Even the person who created the robot called their behaviour barbaric. That kind of brutalization can't be seen as anything less  than rape. Obviously it can't be prosecuted as a crime, but the action is still rape. It is rape practice.

If you can kick it I would drop the car and get a bike, I use it to get around and as long as you live reasonably close to campus it isn't much of a problem. In fact at my campus its faster because traffic gets really bad when classes start for the day. I also use that bike to go into work because it is only slightly farther away than my classes.

0	Mccoy2017		0187		"I actually went to the cinema to see it, after it I felt ripped off. It was like the guy who made it looked up a plot synopsis of og DB and put the synopsis in a blender and shredded it, then he picked out all the pieces of paper and sorted them until they were in a straight line, then he went on Google translate and translated the words to Japanese and then back to English. He then decided to get a group of actors who were so far away from there original designs, the actors themselves aren't too terrible but there acting is like the speedy dub of Dbz at times. The effects were so cheesy, why is the kamehameha a frigging ball of air? Why is Goku a angsty teenager? Why is Mai a thot? Why did Goku chase after Chi-Chi? Why did this movie exist?

Sorry I had to get that off my chest.

Also I'd rather watch any other live action anime over this.

0	askmeforbunnypics		sheet8pos55	The Demon Assasin	"It's mad that Moose's contract is until 2020. I'm not sure why he would sign a really long contract but hey, it's great to see him in Impact. I really do love his in ring capabilities (giant man jumps and drop kicks opponent off the top rope) and he's pretty good on the mic.

If EC3 doesn't resign with Impact then they've dropped the ball something fierce. He is just great. If he and Eli Drake were to team or form a proper rivalry, it would set the world alight.

Kinda upset that Matt Morgan and Tyrus have already left. I hadn't heard of this before but I knew Tyrus was having problems of some sort with Impact management. I hope they do well in the future :) Great potential, both of them."

What I meant with weaker grip was just an example of the abstraction of HP. I dunno how to call it, but maybe the *force of will* or even *luck* the target has. Even heard it called *plot armor.*


 **Just mechanically**, someone with 200 hp is not gonna be in a situation where a knife is placed on his neck in a place that would cause lethal damage. Not implying that the attacker is weaker, he might even have higher STR, just that he's not fulfilling all the conditions to be able to down 200 hp in one strike. This might be represented with a weaker grip or any other way.

In contrast, a 10 hp person is someone who easily would be in a position to get a knife to the neck from someone. 

Obviously this is all my opinion. Just trying to keep the mechanical justification of why there would not be instant kills.

Daniel Bryan was always a nerdy but hardworking guy in the ring, with a violent streak. He never cared what other thought of him, and he was comfortable and confident in himself. But for years they actually hamstrung him by painting those qualities as negative. It was nerd this, dork that, Vegan, goatface, angry troll, all that stuff.

It took them so long to just say, Daniel Bryan is a just Daniel Bryan, he a bit sarcastic, he all business in the ring, and he doesn't like to be told he's not good enough.

How many wrestler had to endure tons of gimmicks that led nowhere, before they were actually given just the freedom to be themselves. The New Day were always funny, they were just seperated and never given the freedom. Same with Breeze and Fandango. Fandango was kind of a creepy idiot way back since the old NXT days. He was gold then, like he's gold now. I always liked Breeze's seriousness in ridiculous situations.

The WWE needs to learn that the best thing to do is just the wrestler work. A gimmick might be done well by a wrestler, but it's the wrestlers that get it over, and are eventually loved by the fans, not the gimmick.

Jericho could show up next week with a gimmick where he's a clown who has explosive diareeha in the ring, and because will probably cheer him on because he's Jericho, they won't sudden love shit clowns."

Not really, you basically can only get untrusted for cheating. VAC and the MM Anticheat/untrusted-system are different things.

The only way to get untrusted is to do some really shady stuff, like modifying values you can't access normally (e.g. tilting/rolling your view), meanwhile VAC picks up cheat-signatures (finds your cheat.exe running) and some more stuff..

This is why you'll see the same names pop up frequently, because it's a specific niche the game wants to fill, but doesn't have many options available to fill it.

0	bexamous				"'small frontal offset' is an odd test..  it doesn't quite represent the real world.  Real world heavier cars will do better in crashes.

The test is driving into a wall at 40mph, which essentially represents a head on collision with another equal weight.  So the test is easier for lighter cars.  In real world you won't only have accidents with equal weight cars, on average you'll have a frontal crash with an average weight car.  A lighter-than-avg car will do worse and a heavier-than-avg will do better.

IIHS:
&gt; The forces in the test are similar to those that would result from a frontal offset crash between two vehicles of the same weight, each going just under 40 mph.

Other tests, eg side impact, use a fixed weight for all cars.. so they're all tested equally.

Use to go before taking care of my face but that was when I didn’t use sunscreen. I think the best routine would be what the person said above. If you are really worried.

0	skatoolaki				"I hadn't realized this, so thank you for bringing it up. I did some Googling on the side-effects and watched a few YT videos of sufferers. That's serious stuff.

I've often thought Trump's mental decline was from something other than actual dementia. I watched a close family member - over a ten year span - go from forgetting her name to, before her death, being stuck in a fetal position. I saw the Alzheimer's slowly (so terribly slowly) eat away at her mind, bit by bit, for a decade as I was growing up. Sure, her verbal vocabulary shrunk some but she'd say off-the-wall things like she needed to pick up some rainbows at the store because she was almost out or that she needed to get home because some or another long-dead relative was there waiting for her. It was more that than losing the ability to convey complicated thoughts or form coherent sentences. Eventually, she just forgot English and reverted to her native tongue but her talk, before that, was child-like though not necessarily stupid. 

I don't see that type of mental decline in Trump, but it does seem his brain is being affected by *something*. Of course, I could be wrong as dementia and Alzheimer's aren't going to affect everyone identically and I only know the case of my family member directly, but I just get the impression that Trump's mental unfitness is due to something other than age-related dementia. I know people his age that are brilliant and sharp still. Your theory could absolutely explain what's happened to his mind. I hope the media does, indeed, look further into this."

0	DyingWish		arizona text	Arizona	"When it's used in a derogatory manner, it tends to be from a joke of a human being.  I don't think I've ever heard it from anyone I respected or admired so, it tends makes me laugh.  It's funny because when people employ it that way, they think they're actually going to land an insult.   But it is sort of like being called a poopy head by a toddler (it is not unlike the slang ""honkey"" for white people.  It's a spitball at most.)  As an insult, it's weak to the point of being funny.  I  just tend to laugh, then stick a feather in my hat and call it macaroni.  Other Americans unfamiliar with its generic use for ""Americans"" abroad might just be confused by the term.  ""Huh?  Yank?  Yankee doodle?  New York Yankees?  What?""

It's also a fairly misdirected word; you're using a word that whole swaths of the country (southerners) don't recognize as being about themselves (I mean, people familiar with its foreign use do but it still kind of a misnomer).  It would be akin to using some sort of Scottish slur to offend someone from England.  

It's like, ""I see what you tried to do but...that just missed entirely.""  That it has been used by foreigners for Americans generally for a long time is kind of irrelevant to us, I mean, we have a famous revolutionary war song about it, plus a baseball team, and a specific idea of what it means to us.  It's anachronistic.  Olde Timey.  It's somewhat odd to me that people still use it abroad.  It is sort of like if we called the British ""redcoats"" or something.  No one ever uses ""limey"" seriously and it's anachronistic in the same way (scurvy, limes, etc.)

I recognize that it's just used generally as a word for ""Americans"" and by itself, it doesn't bother me, though it is curious that it persists.  I don't think it bothers me when it's used an insult either. 

Yank yourselves happy, whether meant as an insult or otherwise.

Have at least one person who knows how this shit works and scales in place to help with the design of the server side hardware and software. As components are completed you start to apply tests to them to figure out how and when they will fail and use that, along with some predictions on load, to plan out the launch of the product. 

Between functional and load testing, ideally both driven from somewhere outside of your network (AWS works fairly well) you should have a really good idea of what's going to happen when too many people hop on, and have methods that you've explored to mitigate or at least fail semi-gracefully. 

Add on some network emulation testing to make sure that even people who don't have a good ping will still have a decent user experience. 

Follow that, and unless your launch is wildly more successful than anticipated it should go reasonably well. And for fuck's sake, if you don't know how to do that stuff, hire someone who does. It's not all that hard to do ahead of time, but the further along your product is before you start to worry about it, the more expensive it will be.

0	drericfautstein				"Welcome to the Chiefs Kingdom!  The most recent generation of Chiefs Teams (Vermeil era, to the Herm Edwards Era, to the Todd Haley era, to the Romeo Crennell era, which brings us to the Andy Reid era) have basically been a middle of the tier or bottom dwelling team, mostly due to terrible defense. We've had a long string of underperforming in the playoffs. Andy Reid has coached the best teams of this group, but he's also had the best players. We've never really drafted a QB high, and we've mostly gone after FA QB's like Joe Montana, Trent Green, Matt Cassel, and Alex Smith. Which is why fans are really excited for Patrick Mahomes, who we traded up to take no.10 overall this year. Most fans expect him to start next year as Alex Smith's replacement. KC teams of basically every era have been known for producing great running-backs, due to a history of having great offensive line play.  At the end of the Vermeil era, we had a potential 4 Hall of Famers along the offensive line (out of 5 lineman) - including Willie Roaf, Bryan Waters, Casey Wieggman (not a HOF'er but could potentially be one), and Will Shields. This offensive line blocked for some of the greatest runners in Chiefs history, including Priest Holmes and Larry Johnson, who were basically money in the bank when it comes to scoring TDs on a weekly basis. KC Chiefs Stadium is known as ""Arrowhead Stadium"" and is a premier tailgating experience, which not all stadiums have. We also have the best mascot ever in KC Wolf.

0	moti0nblurr				"Well, there are indicators of an imminent crash, but it's really hard to tell since the main determining factors here are humans, and humans aren't always rational. The policy of subprime mortgages (which was the bad choices that banks made), meant that mortgages were given out to those who shouldn't have recieved them because they don't make enough to pay them off. This was just a very risky move that banks thought would be fine because they can just sell off the house. The problem with that is, when a lot of people default on their mortgage and the banks try to flip a lot of houses, the prices of those houses fall, in the case of the GFC, by a lot. This meant that the banks lost a lot of money. This was an indicator that a crash could happen, along with the increasing house prices that were just too expensive for a large amount of Americans. It's really hard to tell when the crash will happen, because we just can't tell where the tipping point is, but you can predict that a crash will happen although not many actually did predict that a crash would happen so it caught the public by surprise.

As to how we can prevent another crash, crashes happen all the time (usually once every 8 years). We theoretically can stop these crashes by reducing spending in the economy but people make mistakes and mistakes are what cause crashes. The best way to prevent the GFC happening again is to ensure that you bailout all the banks (Lehman Brothers was allowed to collapse which caused the issues for banks in the first place) and that you ensure that they make smart loaning choices. 

I don't actually have first hand experience of the GFC so I'm not 100% sure how bad it was for America (I live in Australia, one of the only English speaking countries who didn't have a large crash so we actually didn't really feel the effects of the GFC). The great depression caused really bad unemployment as in 25% unemployment bad so it was a very damaging and severe economic crash. It lasted from 1930 until WW2 when employment picked up again. WW2 was what got us out of the great depression. 2008 wasn't as bad and I'm fairly sure we won't experience a great depression level crash again since banks are backed now by the fed who wouldn't let a crash of that scale happen (they'd do what they did in 2008 again) and congress would back them too."

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them ""imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.""
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

The would still take almost a week to get ready and they couldn't leave port until the hurricane was a certain distance away. So we're talking about days. The Hurricane swept


Here is the status of the Hurricane a couple days ago:

http://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/tracking-maria-maria-downgraded-to-tropical-storm-with-70-mph-winds/614646434

http://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/855962/Hurricane-Maria-path-map-where-is-now-tracking-maps-models-NOAA-track-Caribbean

So let's see PR was hit around 10 days ago Sept 20th in the morning. You still couldn't said aid there obviously. 

It was still in the path 9 days ago. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/national/hurricane-maria/?utm_term=.ac9114cef025

In fact it was still in the way and posed a risk to ships traveling from the East Coast even a couple days ago.

Let's just assume they could reasonably leave Saturday. That means if they were 100% ready and optimal conditions with still a risk of the storm affecting movement of the ship. So they get there Sunday/Monday maybe.

All this is a couple of days. Now let's hold the government of PR to the same standard.

They knew the hurricane was coming and failed to provide working generators to all the hospitals. Many are still lacking personal. The ones with generators fail to have enough fuel on hand. Even though they knew this weeks in advance.

PR failed to mobilize all the National Guard. They failed to get the ships out of the harbor. Many still haven't prepared a damage report. PR is unable to distribute supplies due to employees not showing up. One reason they didn't show up is because they told them not to and to call a phone number. Phones are down.

Then you have decades of mismanagement causing the power lines to not be ready, the roads to not be able to withstand it, and not even a good hurricane disaster plan.

Let's be real we're arguing over ifs and buts of the military getting a hospital ship there a couple days in advance with OPTIMAL conditions and great foresight. Yet we keep ignoring the failure on many levels of the local government. Failures on levels for decades.

 I thought my husband was funny looking when I first dated him. Not only did that not matter to me whatsoever, but after falling in love with him I'm basically incapable of seeing him as anything but the cutest living thing on the planet. He's a brilliant, hilarious little pint-sized math nerd who is basically the only person in the world who understands me, and the only person who doesn't confuse the hell out of me. 

 IMO people are shallow AS FUCK in how they act like they want a serious relationship but won't pay a moment's notice to someone who's any less than a 7/10. Like I swear to god, those people's supposed longing for commitment and intimacy is literal bullshit. If you grow old with someone, they're not going to look like a model anymore. All you're going to be left with are their morals, values and sense of humor. God knows, so many people marry hot assholes, and their marriage goes South so fast, it's ridiculous. This shit is why like half of all people get divorced. My friends all date these cheating, sometimes abusive rat bastards, and then make fun of my husband for being 5'4"", while simultaneously asking me why their lives can't be happy like mine.

Their Vidal Icewine is great and they make a dry red Baco Noir that is fantastic and is cheap as hell (~ 8 CAD). Those would be my stops. Jackson Triggs is nice but skipable and Peller I thought was just bad. Don't skip going to see the falls while in the area.

0	mgiuca		2-Queensgaard	You're good. Real good!	"Wow that's amazing. I laughed when they said ""The Monsters faction can gain power by destroying its own units, or have units summon lots of small units to overwhelm the opponent."" 

Edit: Played it for about an hour, so here is a mini review.

It actually feels quite polished, from the nice card art and voice lines, to having a fully voiced single player campaign. Gameplay wise, it's very very much a ripoff of Gwent. Three rows, three rounds, one card per turn, factions with special leader cards.

Balance-wise, it feels more like Witcher 3 Gwent. Cards tend to be low value with no ability, or spells that give no points but have an effect (like adding immunity, or moving a unit), so you can get out-tempoed easily using these cards. Also card draw effects are way under-valued. So it feels like the primitive version of Gwent from TW3 rather than a balanced multiplayer game. But I've only played the SP portion."

I am a student at the University of Iowa as well (a bit older than you, I'm 21) who just finished the first draft of a novel that looks to be about the same length as yours. Unlike you, I'm nowhere near ready to have it published. First off, congratulations! Secondly, how was the process of self-publishing? It's something I will most likely do when I feel my novel is ready, so I'd like to hear about your journey. Finally, how did you decide when the book was finished? It seems that no matter how many revisions I make, I always think that something is lacking. I might be able to better polish the characters, trim down fluff to better specify motivations, or just make all-around improvements. As a result, it seems like I'm going to be trapped in a never-ending loop of revisions. Any advice would be appreciated. I'll make sure to check out your book when I get through my current reading list. Again, congratulations!"

1. Tom is a house cat. He's *supposed* to be there. Jerry, a pesky rodent, is not. 

2. 90% of the battles are initiated by Jerry. Even if they were initiated by Tom, it's justified because he's pretty much fulfilling one of his purposes as a housecat. 

3. Tom has a conscience. In one episode, he threw Jerry and either Nibbles or that little duck outside in a horrible storm, and locked them out of the house. He was so troubled and overcome with guilt from being so cruel, he went out to search for them and bring them back to shelter and safety. Jerry and Nibbles once stole food from a banquet Tom was supposed to be guarding, effectively getting him *executed* at the guillotine. They didn't care either, they just ate their food and sauntered away knowing full well they just got a guard killed. On top of that, Tom has even rescued Jerry from certain doom at the hands of other foreign foes. 

4. Jerry has taken advantage of the kindness of Spike, the bulldog that makes appearances occasionally. Spike, based on his own observations, sees Jerry to be an innocent mouse ritualistically tormented by Tom, so he defends him from Tom on some basis. Jerry has hit Spike with a golf club, repeatedly endangered/harmed him and his son, and framed Tom for all those misdeeds. This is how Jerry treats someone who defends him against Tom. 

5. F*ck Jerry.

On top of that, you won't have 2 INT Frieza's on rotation constantly lowering SSJ3 Goku's attack. The only sacrifice is Broly starting off on 6 ki.

By the time someone gets to you, they gonna be pissed, and you are low man on the totem pole so pay will be crap, and expectations high. Worst part is that your hands are tied in fixing many hardware issues, which will bring your customer feedback scores down no matter what you do. 
Even sadder reality is, if you don't already know someone who personally knows the hiring manager and can refer you, you won't get called for that job anyways. It's probably already filled or in the process of being filled. Too many are willing to take that shit support Rep job just to get into Nintendo and work up from within. Fuck applying to anything through indeed or some random job board. That's not how people get decent jobs. Reach out to some people who work where you want to work via linked in, and ask for informational interviews. Be charming as fuck. Most won't respond, but play the numbers game and someone will.

Shaft is my favorite studio for their avant-garde visuals. If you watch any other shaft show (or at least the ones after Akiyuki Shinbo) you will see that monogatari art direction isn't even *that* different. The directing style is of course tailored around the original light novels (which Nisio Isin himself claimed to be ""unadaptable"" until Shinbo/Shaft convinced him otherwise). This story, at least according to the original author, must be told exactly in the way it was. 

If you don't like the characters or the story don't sweat it, but attacking the directing style by claiming it was trying to hard to be avant-garde and original misses the point a bit.

0	rafaelfy		warrior	Y'ser Tovaras on Cactuar	"I want TBN to be a clear cut DPS gain again. I liked the DRK playstyle more when I had the mentality of ""Use this every possible chance you can to mitigate and get 50 blood for more damage with BS"". This was right after they buffed BS by a small amount. O3S prog was so fun on DRK when I could time my TBN right before Auto Attacks, Dimensional Waves, SpellBladeHoly.

Then they went ahead and buffed SE so now we're back to ""It's only a DPS gain if it gives you a healer GCD"" which is such a dumb mentality to have as a tank.

Someone else also had the interesting idea of making a DA-TBN to give DRK a raid wide mitigation option. You'd only get 100 Blood out of it(minus whatever points you already had), but that's just as much as you'd get from two TBNs for the same cost, so it'd give DRK something to compete with Divine Veil and Shake It Off without crippling its DPS from spending 4800MP."

Yeah it's a huge box with paper armor and no mobility but it also has best-in-tier penetration and pretty respectable gun handling so it can still contribute when bottom tier.

I wouldn't grind it if you don't like playing as a campy sniper because that's all you can really afford to do. If you can sit back and shoot lit targets and understand just how absolutely slow and vulnerable you are then... yeah, sure, go for it. You could be a good samaritan and help people get their ""British vehicles killed"" badge. Church GC is usually the last one anyone needs because nobody plays them lol

0	KaBar42		KNTC	KY- Indiana Non-Res: Ruger LCP 2/S&amp;W SD9	"A new holster is next. I had purchased that one solely because when I first started open carrying, there was a slight uncertainty. 

Kentucky law explicitly says that if a handgun is stored in an enclosed container in a vehicle that was installed by the original manufactured (glove box, back seat pockets, or center console) it is not considered concealed. It is silent on if it is considered concealed if I am carrying it on body in the car. I was worried about risking a illegal concealment charge. So I put it in the center console when driving. Which, obviously, needed some sort of holster. 

After a while, I just said fuck it and stopped unholstering and reholstering my gun every time I got in and out of my truck. If they're going to hit me with a concealment charge for carrying it on body in my car, they were going to find something to hit me with anyway even if it was in my center console. 

Any holsters you would recommend for an S&amp;W SD9VE?

On most bikes both are easy to get to so it's worth checking both. Put the thermostat in a pan of water and boil it - check that it opens fully.

Didn't realize i had to write a tightly crafted statement really as i didn't plan on seeing anyone here i didn't think it necessary. As for what i'm hoping for i never expected an high response rate, my OP is out of concern for my references.

&gt; You are tone deaf to yourself. We all are to a certain extent, but if you are unwilling to look at the feedback without feeling defensive then you will be stuck there. I am not saying this stuff because I have an ax to grind, I am saying it becasue I actually want to help clients and providers connect in a way that is positive for both of them, and often times it is not as positive as it can be because clients don't understand why they are upsetting or offending the provider, and the provider is either limited in what she can say in response of doesn't have the emotional energy to ""teach"" another tone deaf man.

Lacking affective empathy i will never understand really why people get upset regardless of setting.

&gt; I happen to have that energy, and I have 20 plus years of experience to back up what I am saying. You don't have to listen, just like you don't have to do anything that is good for you, but be aware that this is the core of the problem you complain about in your OP.
&gt; We always have choices and yours lead to unhappy endings for you. You don't want to change. Have fun with that.

Once again I'm able to get responses, i'm not dissatisfied with that.

Some say they aren't taking new clients, some say they're not available and some don't reply at all. Usually those 3 groups make up half of the group emails i send out.

My way is trade off for efficiency to being inconsiderate but i imagine is best to stay in the good graces of your references. So i thought to ask what standard practice and etiquette was to not stand out from other clients.

Add water to flour, also add olive oil. This I don't remember exactly how much, maybe like table spoon or a bit more? Nothing wrong with experimenting I guess. Anyways, kneed and let rise a few times and refrigerate at least 24 hours, the longer the better. When cooking I would poke holes with a for and spread a bit of garlic and butter over top of dough. Sometimes cooking it on its own for a few min before adding sauce cheese and toppings.

Especially influential to later metal bands were Ian Gillan's powerful screams and Ritchie Blackmore's virtuoso solos. Deep Purple were also very influential to progressive music as well, with their style evolving over the years and incorporating a variety of genres from art rock to blues to psychedelia and more.

&gt; The Early Days:
Deep Purple's early output ranged from energetic rock (such as their cover of Joe South's ""Hush"", which became an iconic radio hit that climbed to #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart) to strongly classically influenced pieces (such as ""April"", a fan-loved gem from their third album). Their first few albums contained very long solos, such as those on the band's covers of ""Hey Joe"" and ""I'm So Glad"". The appeal of the more heavy, arena-friendly tracks from the group brought them considerable success in the U.S., setting them apart from many English contemporaries, particularly in their 1968 debut album 'Shades of Deep Purple'.

&gt; After their third album, founding member and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in particular felt the band should move in a harder direction. He additionally felt that then singer Rod Evans and bassist Nicky Simper were incapable of working in that direction. Both were therefore let go, and Blackmore had them replaced with singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover from pop rock group Episode Six. What is now thought of as the classic Deep Purple line-up came to be when keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice came in, this line-up being often labeled as 'MK II' (in contrast to the previous 'MK I' with Evans and Simper). 

&gt; The first output of this revamped group was a mixed electric and orchestral album with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, 'Deep Purple in Concert', with the centrepiece being Lord's ""Concerto for Group and Orchestra"". The 1969 release earned some international commercial success despite (or, prehaps, because of) its novetly, reaching #149 on the Billboard 200 chart. The whole project was reputedly initiated after idle chat with the band's manager about the possibility led to him book the orchestra and give the inexperienced composer a deadline to produce the work of a public concert. 

&gt; Following on from this unusual venture were four very influential studio albums over the next four years: 'Deep Purple in Rock', 'Fireball, Machine Head', and 'Who Do We Think We Are?', and the live album 'Made in Japan'. Aside from earning widespread critical acclaim, the band's influence spread as many new hard rock groups looked to their sound. American audiences ate the English group up, with album after album rising up the Billboard 200 chart.
 
Though this lineup still recorded some songs with a lighter, almost pop-like tone such as ""Strange Kind of Woman"" and ""Black Night"", the influence of their new blood and the impetus this provided to the existing members pushed the band strongly in the direction of heavy rock music. Songs such as ""Speed King"", ""Child in Time"", and the massively popular ""Smoke on the Water"" showed the fiery spirit of the group, with Deep Purple achieving sustained international commercial success.

&gt; In 1973, creative tensions led to Gillan and Glover leaving the band, being replaced by previously unknown singer David Coverdale and ex-Trapeze bassist/singer Glenn Hughes. This new lineup continued the success of their predecessors, recording the albums Burn and Stormbringer, and further successful tours and live albums. However, Blackmore became disenchanted with the increasing funk direction he felt the band was taking and left to form Rainbow (a name inspired by the stage set when they performed at the California Jam music festival) with former members of Elf, who had previously toured with Deep Purple as a support act. 

&gt; The band recruited former James Gang guitarist Tommy Bolin and recording Come Taste the Band. It was on the 75/76 tour that the tensions within the band really came to the surface, finishing with their final performance in Liverpool in March 1976, where Coverdale resigned and the band ceased to exist. Tommy Bolin died of a heroin overdose in December 1976 whilst on tour with his solo band. 

&gt; Coverdale went on to form Whitesnake, with Paice and Lord joining Tony Ashton to form the short-lived Paice, Ashton and Lord before they too joined Coverdale in Whitesnake. Hughes completed a solo album but spent most of the 70s and 80s fighting drug addiction which he finally overcome in the 90s and has since produced a string of solo albums. 

&gt; Back again (MK II the 2nd): 
In 1984, Deep Purple's best-known second lineup (Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, and Richie Blackmore) reunited to produce the albums Perfect Strangers and The House of Blue Light. Tensions returned however, and Gillan was fired and replaced by Joe Lynn Turner, formerly of Rainbow. This lineup only lasted for one album, Slaves and Masters, before Ian Gillan returned again for The Battle Rages On. Blackmore subsequently departed the band for good while touring in support of this album, being temporarily replaced by Joe Satriani. During this time, many archival live albums of the original Deep Purple lineup were released, such as Scandinavian Nights (a 1988 release of a 1970 concert) and King Biscuit Flower Hour (a 1995 release of two 1976 concerts) 

&gt; The remaining members recruited Dixie Dregs/Kansas guitarist Steve Morse and, revitalised, produced what many regarded as their best work in many years, Purpendicular, then Abandon before Lord retired and was replaced by former Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne keyboardist Don Airey. This lineup has since recorded the albums Bananas and Rapture of the Deep. 

&gt; While not as influential or commercially successful as in their original incarnation, the band have remained a successful studio and live act throughout this latest period.

0	brickmack				"I don't think thats really a great counterexample. It can only carry like 230 tons, which (while larger than smallsat-class) still results in an upper limit of probably 6 or 7 tons to LEO, expendable, which is still too small for most payloads. Adding reuse will cut that back down to smallsat scales (and reusability is not an option anymore. Any newly developed launcher which is not reusable will fail). Falcon 9 is probably about the absolute smallest I'd consider ""worthwhile"", in that it can meet a non-negligible number of commercial and non-military government performance requirements (remember, the bulk of the launch market is still GTO missions) while still having margin for at least partial reuse, and its over twice that weight. And there is very, very little useful commonality with the 747, so that adds a shitload of extra costs, as mentioned above.

Probably the only decent-ish air launch concept was Crossbow. Still a custom plane, but far larger than this, to the point of being able to carry an EELV-class launcher (and they planned evolvability to a reusable air-launch SSTO), and they understood the economic issue of an aircraft that only flies a few times a year and planned to remedy that by using it for wide cargo delivery on Earth.

Congratulations on publishing your book :) My question is about character development. I have an idea for a fiction story that's been brewing and changing for a couple years now. I've got a good enough idea of the world and outline of events where I think I can start scribbling something down, but I'm at a complete loss on developing my main group of characters, even my protagonist. The only character I have any details for I somehow developed in the span of minutes, like a bolt of lightning. 

Should I expect the others to be similar? Should I just force something? I feel like it's the only mental barrier I have left to getting words down.

0	OneReportersOpinion				"No. Not committing war crimes isn't hard. Trump is suppose to be such a tough deal maker. He is threatening Korea with genocide, why is bending over backwards for Saudi Arabia? Because his policy interests align with them. Interests that have nothing to do with morality or law which means he's continuing the same disastrous globalist policy he ran against. Just admit he's a hypocrite and be honest with yourself. 

All Trump has to do is say that we won't refuel their bombers and the war would end. Simple as that. 

Women and children being killed is totally predictable so he doesn't get credit for not specifically ordering their deaths. 

I know circumstances. It was a raid that the Obama administration wasn't even comfortable with. Trump is so in love with generals and so dumb that he signed off on whatever they put in front of him. Besides the innocents, only a couple of low levels al-Qaeda fighters were killed. A score of innocents and an American operator aren't worth that. Trump rolled the dice with lives and lost a service-member as well as the daughter of an American citizen. Trump couldn't even wait two weeks to commit his first war crime.

Thank you so much! :)
For character development I would suggest writing out the GMC's of each of your characters. Start with the goals- what do they want? Remember to do external goals (getting the treasure) versus external goals (like overcoming past hurts). Then you have motivations- what is driving them to go for their goals? This also has an internal an external factors. Then you have the crisis (also internal and external) from there you'll get a good idea of your characters and what they want and why. I would encourage you to just imagine your characters like they're real people (I treat mine like they are) and explore their personalities. It'll come to you. 
I'd say it all comes in time- as soon as I started writing I knew some of my characters, the others were more shy and I had to learn them slowly, but never force them to tell you who they are. You'll end up not being true to them and the readers will be able to tell. Just start word puking on the page and eventually your brain will uncover what it already knows.
Best of luck and I'm sorry if I rambled too much (it's my fatal flaw)."	True	0	1506816240	moderator	0	0	dnqiq0h	True	t3_73igd9	t1_dnqipzj	/r/ConciseIAmA/comments/73igd9/i_am_brianna_goux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/dnqiq0h/	1509189702	1	False	ConciseIAmA	t5_3jana

After a few complaints, the committee decided the best course of action was to leave it be, since some people had already played the hole.  There was a little flat spot about four feet to the left so the only way to come,etc the hole was to hit it to the flat spot then make the four footer.  If it missed, it went to the fringe and if it had any speed, off the green and about thirty yards down the slope.  I took five putts and was the low man in the group.

It had to be pointed out to us by astronomers. I could see it easily, but it was not super bright and obvious. I don't think you would ever see it unless you were way out in the country, if then.

No they don't.

&gt; Progressives feel they've been used for years by the Obamas, Clintons and their minions who demand Progressives' votes, but then move the party further to the right.

This is obviously wrong, though. The party is way to the left of what it was before the Clintons came along.

&gt; When Progressives get uppity and demand a true left-leaning candidate, the middle of the road Dems slap Progressives around and raise the ghost of liberals-past (Dukakis, Gore) to claim Progressives are un-electable. But 2016 proves middle of roaders like Clinton are un-electable.

You described Obama as a middle of the roader and he won twice.

&gt; Middle of the road, status quo, campaigning against a candidate instead of campaigning for the greater good, is not inspiring. Appealing to interest groups, but ignoring issues that appeal to multiple groups, just hands votes to your opponent

0	ItalianTacticz		s1 9 team-9 country-esp	Real Madrid	"Wow thanks for the huge reply, much much appreciated! It is such a difficult topic I can only assume since a lot of people live and a lot of people die in that kind of situation. And you probably wouldn't know if getting thrown out through the front window would help you survive or take away any chance of surviving. 

A friend of mine were in the middle backseat of a car that went 150/km straight front first into a tree which totaled the entire front of the car all the way in to about half of the two front seats, killing both the driver and the passenger in the front. It left my friend in the backseat clinging on to what little life was left but she died on the spot soon after the ambulance and medics arrived... Really sad story but I think she died fron internal damages from the seatbelt she was wearing, but she most likely didn't stand a chance without it either. 

I've just always been curious about the effect of seatbelts in those kind of situations ever since, and it's not really being discussed publically at all since most times seatbelts saves lives, and when they don't you never really know if the end result would've been any different had the person been thrown out of the car etc.

That's a very overwhelming recommendation and you will definitely need some time to process and discuss with your husband.

It even hurt to **lie down.**  I got through the work day by holding the left leg straight like a peg leg, which resulted in more pain later but got me around semi-OK.  I sometimes dragged my left foot.  I was miserable.

So did you ever just hit a point when you thought your story was ""good enough"" for someone else to see it, or were you just never insecure about things you've wrote? Also, I'm constantly worried that whatever I'm writing isn't really original and is just a rehash of things I've read before, did you ever feel that and if so, how did you overcome it?"

0	temp_sales				"&gt; Everyone is aware of the problems with PubG, but too many people don't realize that money =/= problem being fixed and it also happens to take time.

That would be accurate if the problems plaguing the game haven't existed for an extended period of time and still aren't fixed.

The issue with the main menu defaulting to Solo TPP has existed since the game came out over six months ago. Steam has this on its page: ""RELEASE DATE: Mar 23, 2017"" 

Not only has that not been fixed, [even though it would take less than an hour](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/732lf4/im_getting_really_sick_of_the_pubg_communitys/dnneohc/), but a new bug has been introduced where the server defaults to Asia for everyone ***even though it was working fine before that***. 

One guy spending less than an hour fixing something that costs millions of players seconds every time they encounter it (which is every time they interact with the main menu) is worthwhile because it's the GOD DAM UI. You don't make bad UI for software you want people to use. You make it for software you don't want them to use. Because they aren't gonna want to use it if it is irritating to use it. 

This is just one example. Crouch-jumping being broken is inherently related to jumping through windows since they are intangible. They don't make noise. They don't need to be pre-broken. They don't cause damage either. This gives people who do it an unfair advantage. 

It wouldn't take one developer manually fixing every window to be tangible a month to do it. He might miss some, but those would be reported and then he'd fix those. 

There are teams of developers who work on video games in most cases. A UI team. A netcode team. A game asset team. A game balance team. That type of thing.

No progress for some things isn't acceptable. Especially when they're little things that irritate many people because they're constant. 

The black box glitch when Post Processing is turned up on red dots has existed since release as well. It wasn't fixed until literally everyone had it when Post Processing was forced on universally. That shouldn't have been a thing. It should've been fixed in a reasonable time frame after it was first reported. Like every other bug that affects many and occurs often."

But if you assume the vast majority of the asian population in America has strict parents and often are very hard on their kids, then I don't know how you could be so ignorant, because I've never met an asian person who says much different. Like I said before there's always an exception, but getting mad that stereotypes exist is a waste of energy, people build up misconceptions and widely accept them because it's what they're presented with, the collective population isn't just randomly all racist in unison on the same structural wavelength.

And a lot earlier than that.

There are no laws against drinking for minors in almost all places actually. There are only laws against the sale of alcohol to people younger than 16-18 years old.

It's always funny to me that in the USA you can commit a ""crime"" by ingesting a substance by yourself into your own body just because you're young. It's beyond idiotic. (It's the same logic with other drugs, but at least without the age differentiation and the ""official rationale"" is that by doing illicit drugs you're supporting the drug trade and its consequences, which obviously can't in any way or shape apply to alcohol).

There was several days warning ahead of this particular hurricane that indicated it would do exactly what it subsequently did. The Comfort is maintained for exactly this kind of situation. Any competent management would have prepared better to respond, at the very least having all personnel on standby to head out with a few hours notice. This did not happen, not even a little bit (as far as we know). That lack of preparation is simply one more black mark on this administration's handling of the crisis in Puerto Rico. Which itself is just one more black mark on a wall of same.

0	LucyLee33				Assuming that aliens don't deal with the concept of time or gender like we do, then they'd have no verb tenses and each object would have its own gender. Basically, I imagine they'd have a language with no need to grammar at all. A language based on extreme need only using natural elements in their planets. We humans we tend to use so much unnecessary  language and we subconsciously discriminate each other based on its capacity to speak a language and we put so much emphasis on every noun (gender), verb (tense), adjective (description) and adverb (place, time, cause, circumstance, etc), spelling, pronunciation, etc. We are grammar Nazis by nature. I don't think alien language would be as complicated as our language. Not to mention that we are probably the only species in the universe with over 6909 living languages!

Now I'm not an expert, but buckshots are the type of rounds used to hunt game like Deer and Boars. How can a person, no matter how strong, healthy or willful, survive a blast that knocks out animals way tougher than him without protective garment? Not once but 3 fucking times. Meanwhile a 9mm UMP cuts through a level 2 vest like it's butter. 

I'm trying to find a reason that it was my fault, I truly am, but it just makes 0 bloody sense. I hit the guy and he visibly should've taken a lot of damage the first time, shot him a second time, grazed him with at least half of the shot, still not dead. 3rd time without him healing once - what the f.
Yes, I've one shotted people, but generally it seems clunky AF. It's like shots don't register at all sometimes. I've been one shotted through level 3 vest with a shotgun from behind a corner.

0	myringotomy				"The problem is that real life is messy and ugly. I think too many developers try hard to clean up real life rather than write their apps to function in that messy reality.

Using sinatra, roda etc are great if your app isn't doing much but in real life your app is going to need a ton of stuff like reloading, intricate authentication and authorization, dealing with hostile actors, rate limiting, caching, access to third party APIs and libs, scheduled tasks, background tasks, deployment, clustering, session management, asset management etc.

""simple"" frameworks like roda and sinatra kick the can down the road. Oh look how simple and fast this example code is! Sure it's unsafe to put in production but hey it's fast and only 100 lines long!

By the time you add all the plugins (half of which are unmaintained and undocumented), wrote all the rake tasks, broken up your routes to different files, written all the helpers you need, your new shiny app is as slow as rails and still doesn't do half of what rails does.  You just wasted weeks of work trying to recreate something that has existed under your nose the whole time.

One reason you spent all that time was because the documentation was so weak and you spent hours googling how to do simple stuff.  Some plugins have no place to even ask questions, others send you to vacant slack channels or gitter or who knows what. It's messy and ugly.


What's worse is that rails has a top notch team working on it 24X7 while your pet framework has one or two guys who work on it sporadically.  It will never keep up.

Is rails perfect? Fuck no. It's a memory pig and the team really should spend an entire release doing nothing but memory optimization and speed optimization but the tradeoffs of not using it for production work are too much if you ask me.

I had high hopes for Hanami or another full stack framework to compete with rails but Hanami has another set of dogma it follows and like rails it has found itself intertwined with itself.   I guess that's inevitable. Life is messy solutions that deal with life end up being messy."

0	Nameiwillforget				"Das ist zwar nicht wirklich eine Antwort auf das, was du gefragt hast, aber hier sind ein paar DInge, die ich in meiner Zeit als Mathematikstudent (Hauptuni, Master) gelernt hab:

1. Mathematik ist vollkommen anders als Schulmathematik. Nicht nur das, die Mathematik, die du später machen wirst ist vollkommen anders als die in den ersten Semestern. Gerade deswegen klingen viele Konzepte unmotiviert, wenn du ihnen zum ersten Mal begegnest und erst später wird ihre wahre Bedeutung klar. ZUdem stehen die Motivationen für die Einführung einzelner Gebiete oft miteinander in Konflikt. Zum Beispiel ist eines der ersten Fächer Analysis, die Lehre vom Differenzieren und Integrieren (sehr grob gesagt). Aus abstrakt mathematischer Perspektive sind Diiferentiale und Integrale sehr komplexe Dinge, deren ""algebraische"" Beschreibung (im Sinne von Beschreibung als Rechenoperationen) eine nichttriviale Frage und vielleicht nicht gerade Stoff fürs erste Semester wäre (oder nur sehr anders, siehe 4.). Aus physikalisch motivierter Sicht ergibt es absolut Sinn, Analysis möglichst früh einzuführen, weil zb. quasi alle physikalischen Prozesse Differentialgleichungen involvieren und die Lösung derselben ein gigantisches Teilgebiet angewandter Mathematik ist. DIese verschiedenen Herangehensweisen sorgen dafür, dass viele Studierenden recht schnell eine Vorliebe entweder für Algebra oder Analysis entwickeln. Ich bin tief im algebraischen Teil des Spektrums angesiedelt, aber seitdem ich die ""algebraische Formulierung"" von Analysis kenne, finde ich, dass es mehr die für mich unmotivierte Einführung von Analysis war, die mich abgeschreckt hat als die Analysis selbst. Das bringt mich auch zum zweiten Punkt:

2. Leute entwickeln recht schnell mathematische Geschmäcker, und das kann dann auch gleich mal mit dem Curriculum clashen, das klarerweise versucht, möglichst ""mainstream zu sein"". Am Anfang des Studiums lässt sich nicht wirklich sagen, wo es dich letzten Endes hinverschlagen wird, und du bist selbst dafür verantwortlich, dich möglchst vielen Richtungen auszusetzen, um zu sehen, welche für dich die Richtige ist. Ich geb dir trotzdem schnell eine sehr unvollstängige Liste von Gebieten, auf die du einen Blick werfen solltest, und die in gewisser Weise Geschmackspole sind. Der nächste Absatz ist hoch subjektiv, und nachdem der Post sowieso schon so lang ist, kannst du sonst auch die anderen Punkte vorher lesen.

In Zahlentheorie geht es darum, Gesetze zu finden, die die natürlichen Zahlen befolgen. Vor allem geht es um Primzahlvermutungen und im weiteren Sinne um die Frage, wie Addition und Multiplikation zusammenhängen. DIe Wahrheit ist nämlich,  dass es beängstigend wenig Muster in dem Verhältnis der beiden gibt. Als Beispiel versuch mal, herauszufinden, wiie die Primfaktorzerlergung der Summe zweier Zahlen von der der Summanden abhängt. Generell ist dieses Gebiet gut,wenn du über eine gute Intuition für Zahlen verfügst, und wahrscheinlich noch dem am nächsten, was normale Leute unter Mathematik verstehen. Eine Stufe abstrakter ist Gruppentheorie, die die konkrete Struktur der natürlichen Zahlen mit dem abstrakteren Begriff der Gruppe ersetzt. Irgendwer bekanntes hat mal sowas gesagt wie ""Gruppentheorie ist abstrahiertes Rechnen"" oder so, was den Nagel auf den Kopf trifft.Sie ist aber eines der wichtigeren Gebiete abstrakter Algebra. Generell ist Zahlentheorie meistens die Disziplin, für die gewaltige mathematische Theorien geschaffen werden, die aber im Gegenzug kaum etwas verwertbares an den Rest der Mathematik zurückgibt. Die Sachen die sie zurückgibt laufen aber oft über Gruppentheorie, weil sich viele Sätze über die natürlichen Zahlen recht einfach auf Gruppen verallgemeinern lassen. Der nächste Schritt nach Gruppen sind Ringe, und hier fängt Algebra an, geometrische Bedeutung zu gewinnen, was algebraische Geometrie hervorbringt. Algebraische Geometrie in ihrer heutigen Form ist erst im letzten Jahrhundert entstanden und nimmt eine Art sweet Spot in der Mathematik ein, weil sie geometrisch in ihrer Intuition ist, abstrakt in ihrer Formulierung und hochkomplex in ihrer Theorie. Einer der großen Boni von AlgGeo ist, dass abstrakte algebraische Eigenschaften eine geometrische Entsprechung erhalten und umgekehrt. Eine Maschinerie, die In AlgGeo extrem wichtig ist, zunehmend aber Bedeutung in jedem einzelnen Gebiet der Mathematik erlangt ist Kategorientheorie. Ich kann dir nur raten, einen ernsten Blick auf Kategorientheorie zu werfen (unten Literatur), weil sie für den richtigen Verstand so etwas wie ein goldener Schlüssel zu jedem einzelnen anderen Gebiet sein kann und mehr und mehr zu einer Grundsprache von Mathematik wird. Hier möchte ich kurz das Verhältnis zu Mengenlehre, der anderen Grundstruktur der Mathematik, eingehen. Mengenlehre gibt uns eine Antwort auf die Frage ""Können wir eine mathematische Struktur finden, von solcher Größe und Komplexität, dass wir jede andere Struktur darin ausdrücken können?"". Kategorientheorie dagegen versucht die Frage ""Wie können wir eine Sprache schaffen, die es uns ermöglicht, die essentiellen Eigenschaften einer Konstruktion herauszukristallisieren, ohne uns mti den Details beschäftigen zu müssen?"" zu beantworten. Ein gutes Beispiel ist die Definition eines Vektorraums: Wir könnten uns ohne Probleme einen Vektorraum in der Sprache der Mengenlehre definieren, der Prozess wäre nur unheimlich anstrengend und würde keinen Erkenntnisgewinn hervorbringen. Auf der anderen Seite braucht die Definition eines Vektorraums mit Katgeorientheorie nur einen Satz und ergiebt vollkommenen Sinn, wenn du die allgemeine Theorie dahinter kennst. Deshalb unterstreiche ich die Bedeutung von Kategorientheorie so: sie wirkt in vielen Bereichen wie ein exponentieller Bonus, den du durch einen Haufen initialer Energie erwerben kannst, und je früher du das tust, desto mehr ""Zinsen"". Aber Mengenlehre und Kategorientheorie stehen in gewisser Weise für verschiedene Herangehensweisen an Mathematik, und ich bevorzuge die zweitere sehr stark, weil mir vorkommt, dass die erstere in vielen Fällen einfach aus Sturheit an unintuitiven Herangehensweisen festhält und sich so das Leben selber schwer macht (jeder, der mal ein Lehrbuch axiomatischer Mengenlehre gelesen hat weiß wovon ich rede). Dennoch halte ich es für wichtig zu erwähnen, dass es ein Fach gibt, universelle Algebra, das tief in der Mengenlehretradition ist und für viele Strukturen andere Beschreibungen liefert als Kategorientheorie. Besonders spannend ist Modelltheorie, die Mischung von universeller Algebra mit Logik, die teilweise verblüffende Ergebnisse hervorbringt. Aus kategorientheoretischer Sicht ist Modellthorie eines der wenigen mathematischen Teilgebiete, die noch immer keinen Sinn ergeben.  Auf der exakt gegenüberliegenden Seite zu Algebra liegt Topologie: das Studium von Formen, ohne Rücksicht auf exakte Messungen. Das bekannte Beispiel ist, dass ein Doughnut topologisch genau gleich aussieht wie eine Tasse mit Griff. Während es in Algebra um Rechenoperationen geht, geht es in Topologie um abstrakte Räume. Umso schöner ist es zu sehen, dass sie eigentlich (aber nicht wirklich) genau dasselbe sind. Darum geht es in algebraischer Topologie, ein Gebiet, das, ähnlich wie algebraische Geometrie, an einem sweet Spot von Anschaulichkeit, Abstraktion und Komplexität liegt und tiefe Verbindungen zu Kategorientheorie hat. Übrigens ist algebraische Topologie ein Gebiet, das unumgänglich für manche Gebiete neuerer Physik ist, insbesondere Quantenfeldtheorie und Stringtheorie.

Das sind die Gebiete der Mathematik, für die ich mich interessiere. Es gibt dutzende, die ich nicht erwähnt habe, und von denen ich keine Ahnung hab, und umgekehrt lernst du die meisten davon im Bachelor nie kennen. Das führt mich zum nächsten Punkt:

3. Profs&amp;Co können dir nur beschränkt weiterhelfen. Insbesondere haben sie alle ihre eigenen Geschmäcker, die nicht unbedingt mit deinen übereinstimmen werden. Außerdem sind unsere Universitäten, und ganz besonders der Bachelorunterricht in vieler Hinsicht ziemlich altmodisch. Wenn du wirklich moderne Mathematik kennenlernen willst, musst du selbst suchen.

0	Genera1				"During WWI (and immediately after) Germany was under British naval blockade. This meant not only that German people were under constant threat of starvation (some estimates put the number of deaths caused by starvation in the ballpark of 500000), but also that the whole war industry was having supply problems. Ersatz goods, like synthetic rubber and limited trade for valuable resources (via neighboring neutral countries or with blockade runners) can only get you so far. German troops would often describe abysmal condition of their equipment, with everything from uniform buttons and leather straps to artillery gun barrels being in short supply in addition to ever-present food shortages. 

You also have to keep in mind, that even with Russia out of the war, Germany and Austria-Hungary was still fighting on multiple fronts, with Italian and Balkan theatre still open. With the entry of the US, with its fresh troops and untouched industry, the long term outlook was dire for the Central Powers. Basically, Germany was running out of everything that is needed to fight a war: manpower, money, food and industrial capacity. 

German high command of course realized this, but they also knew that Entente situation wasn't much better at the moment. While supply problem wasn't as bad for Britain and France, both colonial powers with sizable navies and trade capabilities, manpower problem was at least just as bad. French army, with recent mutiny crisis was extremely demoralized, and Americans haven't arrived in sizable numbers yet, not to mention that while fresh, well fed and motivated, US troops were no match for the hardened veterans of the continental warfare, at least for the time being. Russia was tying up bulk of German resources in the East, so after Brest-Litovsk Germany found themselves with around 50 free divisions. 

In March 1918 Germans started their big offensive, known simply as the Spring Offensive, Ludendorff Offensive or Kaiserschlacht. The idea was to gain as much as possible to force armistice, before newly arriving American troops could equalize the temporary disparity. No clear objective of the offensive was established, unlike with previous large scale battles of the western front, with the idea to exploit local tactical situation to gain ground and break through enemy forces. The ideal scenario was a wide breakthrough and outflanking the British forces holding the northern part of the front.

While the offensive itself employed number of revolutionary tactical innovations, such as widespread use of infiltration tactics by German stormtroopers and saw the biggest territorial gains in the West since 1914, it failed to break the French and British. By the April 1918 the danger of a wide breakthrough had passed and Germans used up their strongest troops, especially picked from every unit just to lead the charge in the offensive, enormous amount of materiel set aside for the offensive and were now in possession of vast amounts of relatively low value ground, which was hard to defend with depleted troops. What followed was the Hundred Days Offensive in the West, retaking all the ground lost and braking through the Hindenburg line, with new offensive in the Balkans from the Greek territory, which led Germany to sign the armistice in November 1918.

So long story short, Germany in 1918 was in no position to prolong the war, because of the blockade and the US entry into the war, took the opportunity that arose to finish the war before it became hopeless with the Spring Offensive, but failed win it decisively and force the French to surrender.

And what about Asians (""chinks,"" as you called them) did I ignore?  That the average Asian IQ is three points above that of whites?  3 points is well inside a standard deviation (that's for NE Asians, btw - SE Asians average well below whites), so it's hard to claim that they are ""smarter' than whites.  Do you know what a standard deviation is?  You should, since you claim to have read the Bell Curve.  Further, it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison, as those data were taken largely from Americans of Asian descent, which is a filtered sample.  Or do you disagree?

0	silverionmox		LIM2	Limburg	"&gt; Well the main issue is that White European culture is not under attack in any meaningful way, if anything it's become the de facto worldwide cultural heritage of the entire world with its art, movies, language, philosophical ideals permeating every country worldwide.
&gt; Culture is a very difficult thing to annihilate.

It's actually pretty easy to lose. We lose culture with every generation, it just doesn't seem that way because the current generations consider it oldfashioned or outdated, and the next generations are simply unaware of what it even meant in practice.

So I reckon that many people agreeing with the statement are just disconcerted about the speed of social evolution.

&gt;Another issue I have is with the entire term ""White European Culture"", since that is a rather broad stroke to paint on a super diverse part of the world. The cultural differences between a Belgian, an Italian and Polish person are enormous and the entire concept of ""white culture"" is relatively new.
It's as dismissive and broad as the term ""Asian culture"" (we wouldn't lump in the cultures of Japan, Thailand, India, Mongolia and China afterall)

If Rafferty raped a student, Kraz would go to the cops. He immediately is a hero and eliminates someone who he doesn't like and who is competition for him at work. Plus, you are legally responsible to report abuse like this and he has nothing to lose by doing so. He only wins from reporting a crime like this, both career wise and for personal esteem.

Kraz thinks he deserves to get the award because being the cool teacher means he's trying to connect with the kids. The vandalism occurred the day before the teacher award party and this was confirmed.

Crista would go to the cops if she went to file an official complaint. She's an activist and is used to using official actions to right wrongs. If she was afraid to report abuse to the cops, she probably wouldn't report it to the school. 

Rafferty probably cussed her out. There's not much recourse there other than a complaint. Just like trashing the office is the only way you can retaliate for someone ruining your parent's marriage.

0	Zaphod_B			chown -R us ~/.base	"This should be the top comment IMO.  You cannot code your way around a business model, you can not code your way around expanding your business and growing it into a profitable Org.  You need people that understand business to help you, or as a dev you will need to get outside your comfort zone and learn business.  

In my anecdotal experience success really comes from a few high level key factors:

* You need the right people, they need to believe in what they do and they need to put the business first

* You need capital - VC funding is pretty common, however to negotiate this you will need to know and understand how business works

* You need to provide a good customer experience - the gist of this is that if I download a new app on my phone and the app sucks with in the first ~1 minutes of using it, I uninstall it and find a new one.  This is because Apps are a consumable.  They aren't a long term investment for me, nor are they for anyone else.   Most people treat apps now as a consumable, and there is no investment in it for them at all.  If your app/service gives a bad experience, then people just download the next app that is just like the one you are trying to market.

* You need to have a plan - what happens when you become 15 people?  Then 40 people?   then 100 people?   I worked for a start up before and I was in the early wave of employees (around the 70s) and when I left the company they were over 600 people.   I got in toward the end of the start up phase, but we still had money from VC to invest.   Growing a company is hard, and many companies fail.  Guy Kawaski has wrote a few books on this subject and they are pretty spot on.  My favorite chapter in one of his books is titled:  ""The Bozo Explosion.""   This entire chapter talks about when your company grows and your demand to get people in the Org to fill empty jobs you get desperate and hire anyone you can, and sometimes you hire a bunch of bozos.  Remember the **people make the company**, so if you hire the wrong people you are doing yourself a disservice.   I have witnessed all of these before.  When I got out of the start up Org I went into vendor/consulting space and a lot of my customers were start ups.   I saw the same thing over and over again.   You really need to sit down and plan for every possible outcome you can think of because when these problems hit you and you aren't prepared you are just guessing.   Also, on that note be aware that not everything you plan will ever work out 100%.   So you need to plan for all the things you can, and then find the best solution or coping mechanism to the problem as they arise.

Churchill fucked up the famine in India and could have alleviated it more than what was done, yet that famine, I'm sorry to say, was going to happen no matter what. The only question was how many people were going to die. Churchill and Britain fucked that up. Things get iffy when you're in the middle of a war, and while it's true that Churchill had no love for the Indians, he did not begin a war with the end goal of genocide against an ethnic group. Churchill and Hitler are not equivalent. The death tolls under them aren't even close to equivalent.

The ally cards from zendikar and the humans from inistrad are extremely cheap and synergistic. Certain creatures are called lords like the [[Dire Graft Champion]] but your humans can be different kinds of rulers. Some humans have lord like effects that give other humans +1/+1 counters when they enter the battle field. The counters stick around if they die which makes them more like Robbin hoods as they spread around the wealth.

I would keep your angels of glory rise and have of each of the following cards they can be hard to find but are at mostly 0.50 - 1 dollar. These are the base of this tribal in this color and have stronger utility creatures, that can be swapped in to respond to the hubbies future upgrades as he will more than likely respond with new threats. If you shift from black to green a very powerful and explosive deck opens up with the enchantment [[Hardened Scales]] and a card that makes his murdering your dudes into new cards to recover [[Shaper's Sanctuary]] as well as a few different cool humans to help and a lovely angel that protects them [[Sidgarda Herons Grace]].

Here is what i would suggest to start and this model is kind of a mid range style deck. for tribal you usually want 28 - 30 dudes, and then 20-24 lands and the rest as support. This deck as it is now is a casual deck but has the room to grow to be a strong modern deck with upgrades as you learn. For fun I took your husbands resurrection theme and gave it to you! While also giving you a way to shut his down. 

Multiples are very important they give a deck consistency and in this case flexibility too. This deck is also low on a mana curve which is a distribution of the average mana costs of a deck. Most mid range standard decks sit at 3-4 on the curve while modern decks sit at 2-3. If you are interested in deck building I would look at the mythic spoiler database. they kinda have the majorty of all the cards in each set in a nice display you can just read through. It helps you learn what is out there in a easy way to read and path through

This is a budget list and can run between $18-56 depending on where you can get your cards. Cockitrace is also a great tool which lets you play and build decks for free so you can try them out before you get them. Any ways here is a rough list

Creatures 28

4X[[Zullaport Cutthroat]]

4X[[Hada Freeblade]]

4X[[Kazandu Blademaster]]

4X[[Champion of the perish]]

4X[[Thalia's Lieutenant]]

4X[[Bojuka Brigand]]

2X[[Angels of Glory's rise]]

2X[[Lantern Scout]]

Sorc 6

2X[[March From the Tomb]] / [[Rally the Ancestors]]

2X[[Read the Bones]]

2X[[Crux of Fate]] or [[Fumigate]]

Instants 6 &lt; This spot has high upgrade potential these cards tend to be the most expensive besides lands. The int i will recommend here are sub optimal for an all deck ideology but they should be side boarded out in that case

2X[[Ultimate Price]] vs [[Radiant Purge]] &lt;Mono Colored vs Multi Colored or [[Celestial Purge]]

4X[[Unmake]]

Lands 20

4X[[Bojuka Bog]] &lt; Say good by hubby graveyard &gt;:3

4X[[Scoured Barrens]]

2X[[Isolated Chapel]] &lt;if you have the money after all the other cards

4X [[Swamp]]

6X[[Plains]]

Other notable mentions that if you seem to be having an issues with these buggers will help out and either be potent threats on their own, hard to kill or take out annoying threats. They tend to be costly so that is why I did not include in this list.

[[Secure the Wastes]]

[[Fiend Slayer Paladin]]

[[Fiend Hunter]]

[[Kibara Evangel]]

[[Mirrian Crusder]]

[[Always Watching]]

[[Stasis Snare]]

[[oblivion ring]]

[[Mortify]]

[[Disenchant]]

[[Feat of Resistance]] &lt; protection can remove Auras on your guys

[[Brave the elements]]

Good luck ! I hope you and your hubby have fun and he teaches you. If you get to 50-50 win rate for both your decks that's ideal.

0	daronjay	True			"Yeah, it was a very good set of predictions. It's clear to me that SpaceX just wants to get the damn thing built soonest, so they have decided to go with whatever can possibly work, not the optimums. So we have a higher mass fraction for the BFS because thats feasible now, 9m diameter because it fits in the current facilities, and using the ""Scaled"" raptor at a lower pressure rather than the original monsters, because they KNOW that works right now since they have been scorching the grass at mcgregor with it.

This seems a very SpaceX type decision, it allows incremental improvement like we saw with F9.  Over time, the scaled raptors pressure and efficiency will climb, and the carbon fibre, once better understood, will allow decreases in mass fraction or increases in safety margins, allowing for optimisation in other areas. 

I think we will see the BFR launch in 2020, or at least prototypes of the booster and spaceship which will enable them to test the current unknowns like the horizontal re-entry, legless landing, carbon fibre tankage performance and orbital refueling, and performance will climb steadily from there.

A nation with an exceptionally bad head of the government can win a war too, because there are so many other important factors that need to be considered. Yet, the head of the government seems to get the credit for the victory automatically simply because of his position. It's so dumb. The allied forces probably would've won the war even if a illiterate simpleton was the head of the government of the UK at the time because there were so many other people and things involved that one person really cannot make such a bid difference.

In order to do that you need to build the character from the ground to the point where it's natural to believe he could easily take Fulgrim and convince him to kill his beloved Ferrus. *Then* you can begin to tansform the demigod Horus into a Chaos pawn and see his dramatic falling.

0	rkkrqqqqrssss				My Thermodynamics final was probably one of the hardest finals I have ever taken during undergrad and that was only SOPHOMORE YEAR! We could have one sheet of notes double-sided and it was also open book. You would think that having an open book is great right? It helped a tiny bit, but if you didn't tab stuff out you were spending more time looking through the textbook than answering questions. Maybe your professor is testing the waters and might slap a real exam with questions NOT from the book. SO keep studying like you were since you never know what might happen.

0	yogapantsandcoffee				"Earlier today I was going to make a post regarding exactly this type of behavior! I don't know whether he is Avoidant or a Narcissist. Up until this week I thought Avoidant, but after our huge fight on Monday, I'm beginning to lean toward Cerebral Narcissist. Either way, it's now extremely clear the path I need to take.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for posting this. 

&gt;""Some people fear intimacy and struggle with insecure attachments, like **avoidant attachment** for example.  When this is the case, they subconsciously try to get away from the fear that comes up in the relationship by gaining control in the relationship.  They do this by intermittently reinforcing their partner.  They have no idea that they are in fact doing this.  They partner ends up at their mercy, desperate for the occasional closeness they grant.  An example of this is a man who spends a wonderful night with you and you talk and connect on a deep level one day and the next, he doesn’t return your phone calls and acts like you are strangers and pulls away.  Then, randomly is able to connect again, especially when he senses you pulling away.  The classic hot and cold relationship usually falls into this category.

&gt;For some people however, intermittent reinforcement is much more intentional.  This is especially true for people who fall into what psychologists would label as a personality disorder such as borderline, **narcissism** or sociopathy for example.  They begin a relationship going for control deliberately from the get go.  They are often consciously aware that they are controlling someone in this way. On top of other emotional abuse tactics, like gas lighting, they give or withhold certain needs from their partner, granting them either randomly enough to develop an addiction in their partner or giving them in response to the exact behavior they want to see in their partner.""

The music, the sets, the costumes, the operatic style of acting, the use of classic in-camera special effects (and intentional lack of CGI)... the movie is absolutely *dripping* with Style, much of it heavily influenced by Symbolist and Surrealist painters. It fully deserved its Academy Awards for best sound editing, best makeup and best costume design, and rightfully deserved its nomination for best art direction/set decoration.

The acting is admittedly hit-and-miss, but if you can get past that particular aspect (consider treating it more like an over-the-top campy stage production), then you will find yourself entering a beautiful fantasy world of gothic romance. I absolutely adore this version of Dracula and I've made it a yearly ritual to host a wine-drinking party and watch it with a group of friends every October -- the experience recently made so much better with the completion of my home theater setup of a HD projector and surround sound system. I wish there were more movies like it, but so far it seems to truly be one of a kind -- and perhaps the last of its type (i.e. big budget Hollywood production that insisted on using classic film effects instead of CGI)."

Yeah, I know that living with my family for the rest of my life isn't feasible, I just thought maybe I could get a few more years in while I had the chance. Now it feels like it's the end forever and I didn't appreciate it while I had it. 

I have definitely been trying to meet new people and get involved, but I don't know that it's filling the hole that I feel from missing home. I will definitely continue to do so and try to immerse myself into life here, hopefully I will start to feel better as time goes on. 

And yeah, I know that attending this school will ultimately probably be better for my future, which is what makes it such a hard thing for me to even consider leaving. If anything, I will probably stick it out until the end of the year and see how I feel then. If I'm still not happy then, I don't know what other choice I could make-- I can't live like this for the next four years. But until then I will try to live like I won't be leaving-- I won't just go through the year waiting for the end of the year to come so I can leave, I will truly try to see if life here will work for me.

Ying the strategies are so many as you can imagine.

Assuming not (or at least that you've gotten less than 5 personal cards in the last two years), then **CIP** is definitely your next best bet.  80k points for $5k spend.  It's a business card, though many folks apply with only a ""business"" (i.e., selling old junk on craigslist/ebay/amazon/etsy counts).

After that, keep hitting up Chase for the 5/24-subject personal cards:  United, Marriott, Southwest.  You can also throw in an Amex business card, since that doesn't contribute to 5/24 -- this will help space out the Chase apps some so Chase doesn't clamp down on you about it.

When you do apply, please use the referral links on [Rankt](https://rankt.com/r/churning/referrals/) when you can - it helps give back to the sub by randomizing referral links, or you can search by username if there's somebody who's been helpful to you who you feel deserves the referral."

4. Der beste Weg, Zeug zu lernen ist nicht unbedingt der, der von der Uni praktiziert wird und es liegt an dir, herauszufinden, welcher Zugang sich am besten für dich eignet. Zum Beispiel gibt es einen Zugang zu Analysis, genannt  synthetische Differentialgeometrie, der weitaus näher an der Intuition ist, die die ersten Analytiker und auch führende Differentialgeometer hatten, als der normale Zugang, zu dem Preis, dass du eine logische Regel nicht verwenden kannst. Welcher Zugang letzten Endes besser für dich ist musst du selbst rausfinden, aber letzten Endes kannst du dir durch ein paar Gedanken über die Art, wie du Zeug lernen willst, viele Gedanken beim Lernen selbst sparen und eine kleine Investition an Freizeit kann sich später stark rechnen. A propos:

5. Wie ""anstrengend"" das Mathestudium ist liegt ganz bei dir. Ich zb hab nie viel mit Vorträgen anfangen können und eigne mir Wissen viel lieber durch Bücher an. Übungen kannst du ausführlich und genau durchdenken, oder schnell am Tag davor abschreiben. Tests kannst du oft durch alte Prüfungsaufgaben lernen. Die Wahrheit ist, dass ein Mathematikstudium, je nachdem, wie du es anlegst, das einfachste der MINT-Fächer sein könnte.Aber die heutige mathematische Landschaft ist übersät mit Sachen, die extrem interessant zu wissen wären, aber einen enormen Zeitaufwand erfordern. Ab einem gewissen Punkt bist du entweder in einer Position, dass dein Interesse an Mathematik aus sich selbst heraus zu wachsen beginnt und sie anfängt, zu einem wichtigen Teil deines Lebens zu werden, oder du plätscherst motivationslos dahin, bis du einen Abschluss hast.

Ich kann dir ein paar Leseempfehlungen geben:

Einführung in das mathematische Arbeiten von Schichl und Steinbauer, zwei Profs an der Hauptuni, ist das Buch zur Steop auf der Hauptuni. Es ist sehr stark in klassischer Mathematik verankert, aber es gibt einen guten Einblick in die mathematische Denkweise und ist ohne Vorkenntnisse lesbar.

Algebra: Chapter 0 von Paolo Aluffi könnte mich mehr beeinflusst haben als sonst ihrgendein Mathebuch. Es erklärt die gesamte elementare Algebra aus kategorientheoretischer Sicht und macht damit beide einfacher.Es ist ein sehr modernes und noch recht unbekanntes Algebrabuch, aber ein definitiver hidden Gem. Mein größter Kritikpunkt wär wohl, dass es nie wirklich die Brücke zu algebraischer Geometrie schlägt und deshalb unanschaulicher bleibt als vielleicht notwendig, aber im Vergleich zu anderen Algebrabüchern ist es hundertundeins.

How to Bake Pi von Eugenia Cheng. Das hab ich nie persönlich gelesen, aber die Autorin hat ein echtes Händchen für die Erklärung von Mathematik, also bin ich sicher, dass es gut ist. Es sollte ohne Vorkenntnisse lesbar sein, und es erklärt gut die Grundidee hinter Kategorientheorie.

Auch extrem wertvoll ist das sogenannte nlab (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage): ein wiki, das versucht, alle Dinge über Kategorientheorie zu erklären. Für Fortgeschrittene ist es eine perfekte Art, Kategorientheorie zu lernen und Wikilernen find ich generell um einiges natürlicher als das lineare Lernen aus Büchern, aber grad das nlab braucht gewisse Grundkenntnisse von Mathematik. Ab dann ist es aber wirklich wundervoll: du fängst einfach irgendwo an, indem du dir zb einen Begriff anschaust, von dem du grad gelernt hast, klickst dich durch und durch, verlierst dich und kommst nie wieder zu dem zurück, mit dem du angefangen hast, aber gleichzeitig lernst du unheimlich viel. Es fühlt sich in etwa an wie tvtropes für mathematik.

Lockharts lament (einfach googlen, is online frei erhältlich). Der Text ist eigentlich nur zur Motivation da, aber er ist extrem gut darin, zu motivieren. Ich hab noch nie jemanden die Schönheit von Mathematik eloquenter erklären gehört. 

6. Moderne mathematische Texte sind meist in einem sogenannten Definition-Satz-Beweis Stil verfasst. Das bedeutet so ziemlich genau das was dasteht. Ich kann dir nur raten, Texte (Kapitel, was auch immer eine gute Portion ist), nochmal zu lesen, nachdem du damit durch bist, dabei aber alle Beweise und sonstigen ""Ablenkungen"" auszulassen und dich nur darauf zu konzentrieren, was dir der Autor in wirklich rüberbringen wollte. Umgekehrt könnte es auch eine gute Idee sein, Beweise nochmal durchzugehen, nachdem du sie gelernt hast, und zu versuchen, die einzelnen Schritte aus dem Gedächtnis wiederzugeben.

Das wär alles, was mir im Moment einfallen würd. Mathematik ist ein Studium, in dem du jedes Jahr zurückblickst und verwundert feststellst, dass sich dein gesamtes Bild davon, was Mathematik eigentlich ist gewandelt hat. Es ist unglaublich schön, aber auf eine Art und Weise, die erst einiges an Einarbeitungszeit erfordert, um wirklich geschätzt werden zu können."

However, I don't think you can really say Barbshev is already better. I'd agree defensively yes, but he hasn't played a full year yet or more then 60 games. Not that I'm saying you won't end up being right once all is said and done, but we're definitely getting ahead of ourselves on Barbie.


AA doubled his points after his second year after getting a little under twice the number of games (as one would expect). I'd want to see Barbashev do the same thing before we can claim he's already better. We all know what situations GMs can get in if you go off of simply one year of NHL stats.^^^^^^^Lehtera

And they even have a setup where the author can have a voice worker record on commission, though this severely limits your options for selling the audio book later.

I'm excited to see what you all decide.  Even if you hold off for now, it's nice to know that opportunity will remain available to you in the future.  Whenever you do release it in audio book, if you do, I'll buy that too even though I have it on Kindle.  It wouldn't be the first book I own in both formats, and I have no regrets."

0	themanifoldcuriosity				"&gt; So I'm not the guy in question, but my problem is that you make claims that may very well be true, but don't back them with real examples. For example, I take issue with this statement:

&gt;&gt; Security is the goal of every state and individual. Because of this, states are heavily incentivized to be murky in how they communicate with others. You want to exaggerate your strengths sufficiently, but not to the point that they lose credibility. You want to downplay your weaknesses as much as possible.

He literally spent an entire paragraph arguing how the First World War was an example of this. Moreover, I don't really understand how you can say there are no examples when the topic of that very thread was a prime example of what he's talking about.

The United States going back through the 90s, publicly and exhaustively built a case justifying the use of force in Iraq to effect regime change, built primarily upon the fact that the leadership of Iraq was a) Undermining the security of their neighbouring states (by um, invading them), and b) Undermining the security of the region at large by making repeated attempts to procure weapons of mass destruction.

Indeed, the downfall of Saddam Hussain came about because Iraq's strategy throughout the 90s and leading up to the second invasion was based purely on projecting the idea that it was a credible threat (i.e. That Iraq had tons and tons of WMD waiting to be used on anyone that fucked with them), and downplaying their weakness (i.e. Iraq's WMD program was unfit for purpose).

Even today we're seeing the same thing from North Korea, who are even more blatant in their use of the media to disseminate the very idea that they have things that can hurt us, even as the actual evidence of this is meticulously curated.

&gt;I would argue that most states in the modern world make their military power very obvious. We know exactly how much Japan spends, exactly how many people in China are enlisted

Do we? You know how much Japan spends (because they publish an annual report). You do not know anything about why they spend a given portion on a given scheme other than what they tell you. Are you under the impression that Japan is under obligation to let the entire world know what every facet of its military spending is for? Similarly, you've read something somewhere claiming to tell you how many enlisted men China has in it's military - because again, they have told you. Do you know where these men are and what they're being directed to be doing now? A year from now? Five years from now? I doubt it. 

You know that the USA is working on a new super jet fighter, and the UK has a new air carrier and that Russia is refurbishing their nukes. Why? Because like OP says, states want the world to know that they are strong. Indeed, these countries fall over themselves to regularly announce - in public - that these missiles, boats and planes are state of the art, unkillable game changers. Regardless of whether they are or aren't.

Do you have access to Russia's nuclear codes, or the secrets behind the new American plane's state of the art missile systems, or the carrier's electronic warfare suite? No, because that would mean other states can use that to negate them - which is an obvious weakness.

If every state's military prowess is an open book, why does every state have large and widespread security operations, working on protecting their own secrets and finding out those of others?
Nothing you've written refute's OP's comment at all. Indeed, it's quite bizarre that you cannot see how your assertion here bolster's OPs argument pretty comprehensively.

And:

&gt;I would also argue that your whole mindset is rapidly becoming...

...this portion of the comment is just straight up bizarre in that it not only does it appear to not bear any relation to any topic OP was even talking about, but doesn't do anything to refute anything OP has stated: If as you say, more states will attempt to procure weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, then their neighbouring states/any state that has a problem with them, have a clear and obvious incentive to try and neutralise them... which in turn gives these states a clear and obvious incentive to be very murky in how they conduct themselves on the global stage, knowing as they do at any time any other given country will be engaged in efforts to find out just what the extent of their power is and how to counter that.

And if you feel this is only a concern of third world states, you have failed manifestly to back that up with any actual evidence. Or indeed anything approaching an intelligent view - because I can tell you ""security will become meaningless"" as more and more countries gain access to powerful weapons is just about the most backwards thing I've ever read.

[+BriannaMGoux:](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/737yli/i_am_brianna_goux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/)

Here’s a bit about me:
My name is Brianna Goux

I have an unhealthy obsession with giraffes 

I’m graduating from the University of Iowa this May

I own a cat, a dog, a horse, and probably have a future animal hoarding problem.

My proof: besides being the only Brianna Goux alive (and maybe ever), here is some proof that I am who I say I am.

[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/2BsSkBF.jpg), [proof](https://i.imgur.com/YRNVhKz.jpg), [proof](https://i.imgur.com/lRjaDk6.jpg) and my [cat](https://i.imgur.com/qZNTZiq.jpg) (not proof, I just think she's cute). Oh, and [my website](http://www.amarasrose.com/)

Hello! I’m the author of Amara’s Rose- a Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy novel with kickass female leads. I started writing this novel because when I went to middle school all of my friends when to different schools so Rose, Phoenix, Sylvia, and Derek became my friends. I wrote of their adventures and from that this book came forth. My motivation for carrying this novel through the long, arduous process of taking it from a shitty first draft, through editing, and to publishing is that I wanted to write the characters I wish I had read growing up. This book is groundbreaking for this genre in that four out of my five main characters are female, there are no predominant romantic plots or love triangles; there is only a mission Rose is on to save her people and the determination of my characters to save their world. 

I’ve been writing for as long as I can remember and have gone from writing short stories about a border collie named Millie to writing 400 page novels about Rose and her intergalactic adventures. The first novel, which was published a few days ago, I have been working on for five years. Ask me anything about life, writing, or giraffes- I’ve got answers for you.

EDIT: [Amazon link for those of you asking](https://www.amazon.com/Amaras-Rose-Chronicles-Key-1/dp/1770843310/)

EDIT 2: I've been at this for seven hours- I'm going to take a quick 30 minute break

EDIT 3: It's been 9 1/2 hours- I'll try and answer the remaining questions tomorrow. I'm going to try to get to everyone so don't fear if I haven't answered your questions yet!

FINAL EDIT: I wanted to answer everyone's question, but unfortunately things are going south. I am not perfect, this is my first novel, and I have a lot to learn. I'm happy that many of you seem interested, and I'm happy that many of you gave me feedback. I'm always looking to learn and feel as though this situation has taught me a lot. Cheers!

 are some of the main themes you adress in this book?

: ux_a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/dnodwfm/):  Ohhhh, I like your view on

: that. I think that it could be, for certain novels, but I wouldn't put the

: whole genre in there. This is because there are books, like mine, where the

: main characters aren't human and therefore it creates a different balance of

: things. However, I could see the validity of your point in novels that do

: feature humans in outlandish situations.  My main themes that are addressed

: within this book are ambition, coming of age, courage, discovery, and loss.

:: _a_19_year_old_redditor_who_has/dnoeidp/):  Thanks for the reply!   I think

:: that even in books that feature primarily or solely non-human characters

:: the main scope would still fall under sociology, since it is impossible to

:: be completely divorced from our own humanity. It would then be a view of

:: humanity through an alien lens, but still a human view by necessity.

:: Because if it were to be fully alien then there would be nothing for a

:: human reader to identify themselves with.   In the seminal ""The Dance of

:: the Changer and Three"" by Terry Carr the only human character is the

:: narrator who tries to explain this fully alien story to a human audience

:: and coming to the conclusion that the story must be taken as is, because

:: they are alien any human interpretation of this story that is so important

:: to this alien culture must always fall flat because we cannot ever

:: completely understand their psychology.   The Dance of the Changer and

:: Three teaches us that whatever we do, we will always be locked inside our

:: own skulls, viewing the universe through human eyes.   I  wish you the best

:: and hope your book is a great success. :)

&gt;
&gt;TLDR of original post: After our mom died, people from HOA came to me and my sister and told us that we're no longer a single family and one of us needs to leave.
&gt;
&gt;So I first confirmed that they are from the HOA, not just some people harassing us for the fun of it. We also got the CC&amp;R of the HOA, which included a clause about single family and it's weird definition. If included partners, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, step parents, step children, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews, children of uncles and aunts, children of nieces and nephews, BUT NO SIBLINGS. It even had a clause that said co-owners are not allowed to live there unless they are a single family based on the definition.
&gt;
&gt;We also received a letter from them telling us of our violation and demanding us to comply.
&gt;
&gt;So my sister and I went around the neighborhood and gave copies of the terms and the letter we received to everyone and told them ""imagine you died tomorrow, do you want them to kick out your kids? Because they're doing it to us. They will do it to your kids as well. Help us stop them.""
&gt;
&gt;We gathered signatures and had almost everyone contact the president and demand that this should stop. Within two weeks, we received a letter that says this has been a mistake with an apology.
&gt;
&gt;We learned that this HOA is horrible to everyone, not just us. So there are now people preparing to run for the HOA board to replace the current members and they're promising to have a referendum about whether the HOA should be dissolved or not, because it really is doing nothing of substance except being a pain in the butt of everyone.
&gt;
&gt;Summary: HOA backed off after we told everyone what they're trying to do. We will vote the board out of office and there will be a referendum about dissolving it altogether as we don't need it.

The Christian bakeries wouldn't be denying service based on the customers' religion, but rather based on the theme of the cake. I'm gay and as anti-theistic as they come, but this seems like a pretty cruel thing to do to somebody with genuinely held religious beliefs.

It is something I want but sadly im the last survivor out of my family, I was born quite late, my parents were both 49 when I was born and much of their family had already passed, Im 25 now and have no living relatives

True asexuality, it would be easier if I just lacked confidence but its a brick wall when it comes to love, friends would be something im interested in but then it comes down to ""whats the point"", i dont know how to have fun without being good at something and winning, so what would a friend do, you know? i realize this is a bad mindset, but thats half of why im here

The kids thing is just, I looked up what makes people happy and a lot of them said, just living, love, having kids, having family, etc. so I wanted to make it clear here that kids isnt on the menu for me, I love kids but I feel like it would not be fair for me to adopt a child because of my disability / depression

Yeah and this is my problem with video games, I dont know how to have fun if im not the best and winning, I play to win, Ive never known how to play a game for fun, which is really bad, i know. About being the top 0.1% in the game, thats what Im talking about, THAT is my passion, but I feel like its way beyond my reach

Sort of answered the friends thing earlier so Ill skip that here

Yeah thats true, I just really wish I could find a hobby that I was really good at that even had the slightest bit of reward

Basically, the Pinlock is a sheet of special plastic that sits inside your visor.  Special plastic in that it absorbs water vapor to a point, preventing fogging inside your helmet visor in humid or cold conditions.  Big safety coup, right?  

There's one on my Shoei GT Air.  Came with the helmet.  Never really worked right.  It has to make a perfect seal with the visor surface all the way around, or moist air will get in and fog the visor.  The bottom edge of the Pinlock NEVER sealed for the first year I had the helmet.  Whenever I had the visor closed, I had to put up with a foggy area in the bottom center of my field of view.

The eccentric adjustment pins are a shitshow.  They are supposed to let you adjust the force with which the Pinlock is pressed against the inner visor surface, to ensure a good seal.  The pins are not equipped with any feature to make them easy to turn.  And they are prone to breakage when you do manage to force them to turn.  Made of clear plastic, and did I mention tiny?  Once dropped one on my white tile kitchen floor.  Spent about an hour on the floor looking for it, including with a flashlight, looked under the fridge, range...nada.  It might as well have gone into a black hole.

Wait, it gets better: for a shitton of Shoei helmets at least, you literally cannot buy replacement pins anywhere.  Even from Pinlock themselves.  Even if you buy a ($35) replacement Pinlock insert, it does not come with replacement pins.  The only way I've got new pins is by calling Shoei.  They'll generally take pity and send you one at a time.  They're good about sending them out quickly, and I got each in about 3 business days, but...lose one on a weekend or early in a long trip?  Sucks to be you.  Seemingly NO ONE stocks the pins.  Not Cycle Gear, not the Suzuki dealership, no one.

This is not a new product, either.  My particular helmet and visor design has been around for at least 2 years.

The Pinlock material is so shockingly soft that it scratches if you look at it funny.  If it ever gets dirty, you might as well throw it away and buy a new Pinlock.  If you do clean it, air-drying is the only option.  A microfiber cloth made so many small scratches that I lived with a light haze for the last several months.

Want to be done with the whole mess, and just discard the Pinlock and its pins?  Well, now you have two ~5 mm holes in your visor.  Which let in rain and (more significantly) wind noise at highway speed.  Lovely.  I put clear tape over mine when I was missing a pin for a couple of weeks.  Looked like crap though.

You can leave the pins in without the Pinlock, but they're easy to accidentally knock out.  If one falls on the ground, forget it, you're never finding it.

In the end, I gave in and tried a completely new Pinlock insert.  Bingo, seals perfectly, no scratches (I won't be dumb enough to try cleaning this one!), but of course it was about $35. :/  But I'll have to replace it again in a year or less.  It seems the plastic stretches or sags over time.

I wouldn't *not* buy a different helmet because it has Pinlock, but I definitely will not consider having Pinlock as a reason to pick one helmet over another, when the time comes."

&gt; his distractions and stop when I call for him to stop.

Every dog is different, and even within breeds, dogs can act differently.

With that out of the way, I -- who has cared for five different Beagles -- would *never* trust them off-leash not to start tracking. They're just wired that way. They are extremely dedicated to both their nose and their purpose. And once they start tracking, they can't hear you. You could be issuing every ""emergency recall"" command you have, but it won't enter their ears. They become so singularly focused once on a good trail. Plus, they can't hear you over their own ball barking.

Training an emergency recall isn't a bad idea, though. I use ""**CHEESE**"" but I've also heard a great phrase for it -- ""**FREE DONUT**"" (because who can sound unexcited yelling ""free donuts""). If you can catch them unsecured but before they get a trail to track, it can work.

Any advice along the lines of ""try falling down; your dog will come back to check on you"" won't work. I've tried it. My dogs were hilariously unconcerned."

As an AI, it would not know the concept of morality via logic simply because it is built to grow upon its own form via upgrades.

0	KolobOrKobol			All this has happened before...	I wonder about this. Despite what Oaks might want to believe, accepting LGBT rights is getting more and more popular. You see people like Mormons Building Bridges, which I think is an useless group but that nonetheless shows that Mormons are getting tired of the rhetoric and are doing their own grassroots movements. Oaks will probably get to be prophet for a little bit, and I wonder if his doggedness will be a tipping point for a big exodus.

The best any of us can do is assess and take reasonable precautions. I think had the therapist felt unsafe and the patient's judgement was compromised, it could have been cause for a 911 call or at the least, a more direct confrontation of the patient's motives.

The problem is that it's hard to do the things that need to be done to the economy without the government intervening in the free market.  Breaking oligarchies should be a major issue, but it's not discussed by anyone but progressives.  Eliminating tax loopholes for big business would also help as it would level the playing field somewhat between big and small business.  Increasing investment in infrastructure is the best, most proven way to increase wealth (and grow our way out of the deficit) but that requires Government spending, which isn't popular when Democrats are in power.

0	9yrMSgt_aintmakinSr		active	Active Duty	"Okay, I'll use the Army model.  They have three branches of people.  You are either Combat Arms, Combat Support, or Combat Service Support.  

Combat Arms is the simplest to understand.  They are directly engaged in hostile operations.  They demand the greatest degree of support.  All other tiers should be squarely focused on getting these guys what they need to be effective and come back safely.

Combat Support are all functions directly tied to combat operations that don't involve triggering a weapon.  They could be intel, maintenance, weapons trainers, etc.  They demand a great deal of support but are generally further back from the lines so their immediate need is less.  

Combat Service Support is largely infrastructure support.  They do not have a **direct** combat related function but they are necessary to sustain the fight.  Here we are talking personnel, finance, gym, chow hall, lodging, and non-deployed legal teams.  NOTE:  Many of these people take on additional roles as security augmentees when deployed.

Most people (~70%) in the USAF fall into the second tier, Combat Support.

Personally I wouldn't go because I have absolutely no desire to go at all.  In fact, I have turned off the TV entirely for the most part.  I find the less I watch I have very little desire to even watch it.  This has been profoundly helpful in giving me more time to do things that are more important in God's Kingdom, being here on reddit is one of them surprisingly!  Who would have thought that being on reddit is a good thing!?  ;)  But answering people's questions about salvation and pointing people to Jesus is a better use of my time.  I did get into a bit of a needless debate with someone the other day (it can happen if I let myself) so I told my husband, ""I was bad on reddit today.""  He looked at me with this look of, ""Um? Bad on reddit?""  I then realized that being ""bad on reddit"" has an entirely different level than I was referring to.  I then imagined posting a bunch of pics on ""Girls gone wild"" or something!  LOL  (as if!)  I laughed and said I better be rephrase that.  I then said I had gotten into a pointless argument on religion that wasn't at all fruitful and had been sarcastic.  Funny though.

&gt; 
&gt; It’s aimed at detecting minuscule traces of mutant DNA produced by the tumor.
&gt; 
&gt; If there’s no malignant tumor but only a benign growth or pre-cancer, these bits of DNA shouldn’t exist at all.
&gt; 
&gt; This mutant cancer DNA, technically called “circulating tumor DNA,” is something of a mystery.
&gt; 
&gt; Nobody really understands why cancers shed bits of DNA into the bloodstream.
&gt; But it could be a stroke of good luck that they do.
&gt; 
&gt; Pancreatic cancers carry certain signature genetic mutations -- ones that Vogelstein’s screen was set up to detect.

0	RoastedTurkey		slash		"Yes, QC is different from previous quakes, but not in the sense /u/Freyr61 means, In CS:GO you can't move all too much if you want to be accurate. That coupled with the fact that you simply can't go over 300 units/s means that overall your targets are moving a hell of a lot slower which in turn results in easier to hit targets.

That's why CS:GO **benefits** from accurate hitboxes while in QC it *detracts* from the player experience.

Besides. Right now QC is using low-poly models of the characters for hitboxes that animate just as the actual models themselves. In CS:GO they use pill-shaped hitboxes that approximate the model and are a bit generous (!!!) depending on the character (this means that there is a CT hitbox used for all CT models and a T hitbox for all T hitboxes).

Then on top of that CS:GO already has it that the models are static a lot of the times (and thank fuck that it's getting implemented in QC).

That's right, on top of targets moving **slower overall** hitting a target that's ADADAD-ing is easier in CS:GO than it is in QC."

Hours will get crazy around the holidays- I was working 40 hours a week this time last year. You will get more gratis around xmas and the brands will offer additional discounts which is kinda cool. 

Talk to the prestige manager and let them know you have an interest in that department and they can help you. You may also want to look into working at a counter in the store. Corporate kind of sucks, tbh.

It they had simply written ""Life was like a box of chocolates"" then it would have been confusing because someone doesn't go up to someone else and say ""life was like a box of chocolates."" When Forrest says it in the movie, he says ""Mom said life was like a box of chocolates."" Not ""Mom said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates.'"" He wasn't quoting her, he was saying that she said it. Big difference. We can assume that the back of the box was quoting Forrest's mother (the quote that we never actually hear in the movie) rather than Forrest himself.

This is just a theory of course, but a pretty plausible one (though it still doesn't explain why people remember it the other way, unless they are simply remembering the back of the box or something). I'm not sure if I explained well enough for you to understand what I'm saying, but I tried."

0	FIYoungster				"I bought a foreclosed SF (Single Family) home 2,000 square feet for 130,000  and live in one room and rent out one of the others. Because of  the opportunity cost of renting, I am able to get a ROR of 27% on my down payment of 27,000 (600/month) not including maintenance or vacancy. I got lucky and the house I found was already renovated but couldn't sell and I found a renter who's family lives behind me making her a consistent renter at competitive rental prices. 

Something similar with a foreclosed duplex or even four plex is always a great option for beginners like ourselves. Also, if you can rent to a responsible renter, they will take care of the place for you and even improve all the little things! Something I didn't know but was gladly surprised about. 

EDIT: Everything I read also said you should make your money going in by buying well under market value (25%) but I wasn't able to do this because I was competing with investors that could buy homes 100% in cash. Therefore I fell into a less competitive market by looking for roughly 5% below market value with good cash flow. Just FYI on my experience."

 As for caring for her, I keep half the tank soaked with water with six inches of substrate wet. I live in the desert where it's dry so I keep extra attention to that.

I've been doing this for about 17 years, and the longer I'm in, the more it feels like a vicious, unending cycle of futility. 

It's only recently that I've come to the realization that most of my frustration and my habit of taking things so much to heart is because I've defined a lot of myself as a person on the success (or lack of) in my career. My advice as a fellow geezer is more practical than deeply insightful:

Most of us I'd wager work so that we can support ourselves, our families, and lead a generally good life with some semblance of stability. As people who have spent years advancing their trade, we feel compelled to ""engineer"" things toward the way we feel they should be. Right or wrong, it takes a very conscious effort and a lot of emotional discipline to be able to let go of that idea of perfection (as we see it) and ""do good where we can"", while being satisfied with just controlling the things we can control.

Work so you can find the balance for yourself and your coworkers. If you find that, over time, despite your efforts you can't achieve that balance, be mindful not to take it personally and move on.

Making it feintable would cause it to be low-risk since, you kmow, you can just cancel it if the opponent threw a feint.

Its an important distinction.  
.  
Of course your income tax is not 100% medical, its covers lots of stuff. But, all those govt services are also funded by HST / GST, home taxes and things like fuel tariffs.  
.  
What Im saying is for people in high income bands ... they would get better service paying private insurance, especially for 20K a year or even 5K a year. In Canada, they subsidize the rest of the population's medical costs.

0	e-neko				"You are trying to explain E=mc2 to me again. Yes, in empty universe with only em-drive present, it could only obtain velocity by shedding mass (be it emitted in photons or exhaust particles or even macroscopic projectiles).

Em-drive doesn't exist in an empty universe.

Like a simple electromagnet-powered ""craft"" would easily (and efficiently) pull itself towards your block of steel, so could em-drive pull itself towards (or away from) distant objects in the universe using some form of energy field.

As I suggested earlier, it probably is some form of gravity.

Alternatively, it could be some other, unknown quantum-mechanical effect, that works on physical vacuum (and somehow transfers momentum to it). Firstly, I am skeptical of that happening at such a low energy limit, secondly, I am not sure it would be distinguishable from gravity.

A briefly mentioned [here: wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%E2%80%93Juday_warp-field_interferometer#Interferometer_experiment_with_a_resonant_cavity) interferometer experiment also hints at gravity-like effects occurring within the cavity (unless something else can slow light).

If I were working on an em-drive model experiment, I'd certainly place a few accelerometers around the device to try and demonstrate some form of directed ""gravity beam"" or some other evidence of warp field presence (like... interferometers?)"

0	hihilist				"Because the only thing in existence is existence itself. Everything is affected by everything else in the Universe and, hopefully, the Mulitverse. This everything is just one. There is no ""truth"" or ""meaning"" or ""individuality"". But because we are the inputs and outputs of our brain and body we have to be human and assign value to things and people depending on our preference. And we have to pretend that our actions come from an innate ability to choose different futures when really free will is only possible because our brains are not large or smart or objective enough to process all of existence at once. So we have to use abstract concepts that we can never fully define to each other since every person thinks differently to explain an existence that is fundamentally one but viewed from multiple, relative perspectives. Basically everyone who spends more than 10 minutes doing any thinking will realise that nihilism is the only philosophy that can be used as the foundation of the self. The only philosophy that allows us to be and do anything we want. Not because things are ""meaningless"" but because anything we do or are is neither wrong nor right. Only knowing that you can build an identity that is truly your own. And you can change that identity whenever you choose so you can be more comfortable with your ignorant, irrelevant, and non existent ""individual"" reality. You don't need to grow a brain or a pair of balls to stop being nihilistic. You only need to have a wrong idea of what nihilism is."

0	trumputin77				"In the OP's case virginity means there is an underlying problem which is why I said he and not another pronoun. 

Very religious people and asexuals are not ashamed of being virgins. 

outside of those and other very small niche groups, everyone wants to have sex with someone else. 

&gt; even if that is the reason, that doesn't necessarily cross over into any other social experience.

To a small extent it does. Selling yourself, building rapport, finding common ground, showing your strengths, getting over anxiety, persistence, presenting yourself well, basic grooming, apply to both interviews and dating. 

&gt; I am kinda concerned about how much attention you're paying to how often other people are having sex that you think you can categorically say, based only on your own perception, that socially awkward people don't have sex. I think you have your own narrative about what it means to be a virgin, and you're supporting it with assumptions.

This makes you sound like a but hurt virgin. Especially since I actually said plenty of awkward guys find girlfriends and have sex. There's a difference between a 21 year old virgin and a 30 year old virgin.

0	Draxtier				"My reading of the legal system for Waterdeep through 1st - 3rd edition is that it's an [inquisitorial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisitorial_system) rather than the adversarial system most of us are used to, based off of English common law. This has the Magisters (Black Robes) of the Common Court or the masked Lords of the Lord's Court fulfilling the function of prosecution, defense, judge and jury, meaning that there are no professional defense or prosecuting attorneys. Waterdeep's system doesn't need them or really allow for them. Magisters are empowered to interrogate anyone and everyone and there is no right to remain silent.

But litigators aren't the only kind of lawyers. What does Waterdeep do in place of the myriad other functions performed by real world lawyers?

&gt;34. The Scriveners,
Scribes, &amp; Clerks Guild

&gt;This guild is a highly educated, professional group of men and
women who letter signs, draw pictures (sometimes in front of a
party audience, upon a noble's hiring), compose and write letters,
take dictation, design ornamental scripts, draw up legal
tallies, and set down records, contracts, and accounts. Many
guild members will even forge or counterfeit documents; these
cost some very stiff fees hundreds of gold pieces per document
 since the penalties are so severe: Expulsion from Guild
and city for very serious cases, with amputation of fingers and
thumbs added if the forgery is treasonous or inflammatory, in a
manner that threatens the peace of the area.
**The Palace retains a dozen guild members at all times to
transcribe a record of all said before it, and retains one
scribe for each Magister (for the same task).** The watch also
employs guild members to draw likenesses of fugitives
described by witnesses, so that watch officers can carry
these sketches when on patrol.

Under the list of services provided by this guild you have: accounting, art, bookkeeping, clerks, counterfeiting, **court records**, dictation, documents, letters (written), portraits, record-keeping, scribes, scriveners, ""wanted"" likenesses.

I interpret that to mean the law in Waterdeep has always been systematized, it's just maintained without what we would understand as professional attorneys. I'm less familiar with 4e-5e."

Iniesta and Messi would have still been there and been great but they would not have gone down in history as possibly the greatest club side ever.

0	ddaniel87				"&gt; Awakening is something that is difficult to define because it’s characterized more by what is missing rather than what is gained. One might say that it describes a realization of Truth recognized beyond the need for belief.

&gt; While there are as many descriptions as there are perspectives, most agree that they fall short of the realization itself—a recognition so profound that it shakes the very bedrock of one’s understanding of the world and oneself.

From the sidebar. I'd also recommend reading the FAQ. 

For me, awakening is an ever-deepening realization into the fundamental nature of our being and of reality itself. It's commonly used to show that someone has 'woken up' to the realization that the person they previously took themselves to be (the individual sense of self) is without actual substance or reality (no self) and yet is connected to and in fact one with the world around it (unity). 

It can come in glimpses (non-abiding awakening) or as a permanent shift in one's sense of identity (abiding awakening). 

That said, any descriptions will always be incomplete, because it is not something that can be understood by the mind. It must be experienced.

Symbolic systems in mathematics are socially constructed.

And most people are platonists (with a lowercase 'p'), also known as 'mathematical realists' (very generally speaking), who want to preserve the intuition that mathematical entities (like numbers) are mind-independent.

One way of fleshing out an intuition about mind-independence is by saying that if everyone on Earth were to be obliterated in a nuclear holocaust, then it would still be true that 1+1=2.

The eject mechanism is also driven by the same belt so that would explain why it's slow to eject. It's likely been sitting a long time, and the seller just said it worked because ""it worked last time I used it 15 years ago"", but once you started playing with it, the belt started stretching and loosening up. It's likely got a lot of slack in it now or has broken in half. 

SMC Electronics doesn't appear to have a belt but you can contact them and ask if they know what kind of generic belt you need.  http://smcelectronics.com/index.shtml

If you are unable to fix the VCR, I'd open a case with eBay for a defective item and try and get your money back, if you're lucky the seller won't want it back and just give you the money back and tell you to keep it. 

Going to Goodwill for VCR's is a better bet, and you can live-test them in the store. There really is no way to avoid having to repair a VCR today because they are all aging, and mostly all of them have been dumped in a attic or basement for decades and break from just sitting unused."

In fact, I believe one of the reason mangas tend to be inferior to, say, books, is that there are many writers which are okay to spend two hours a day for ten years alone in their room to write their masterpiece while the same just isn't true for mangakas, who want instead to make a career out of it (I am not judging their choice, be clear).

Puerto Rico is a tiny country surrounded by a huge ocean to quote our president. We shouldn't just pick and choose who we help because of convenience. The American people deserve the first response, Puerto Rico is and American territory, therefore those people deserve AT LEAST our second hand resources. But that's really just my opinion, I couldn't attest to the amount of money we can put into disaster relief or the amount of resources we do or don't have, but I'm pretty sure that you can't either.

0	letstalkaboutbras			UK 28F/FF, Comexim 60HH, narrow/projected/soft/pendulous	"Yay, I'm so glad Victoria went to a happy home and that she's comfy. 

You're right about the gore on that one. I think I've only ever had one other bra from Comexim without the overlap that I requested. Weird. But all the ones I have that are overlapping are technically to varying degrees if you look close. I look that closely because my boobs are super picky little divas.

Oh, the cup side-dents. I am sad that this happens for you, but I admit that it does make me feel a little less crazy since I feel like no one else ever reports it. I wish I had a real answer to why this happens. I thought the issue was behind me when I gave up on the 3HC (after three strikes with Victoria). I have a bunch of 60HH plunges from Comexim that show absolutely zero signs of this anomaly, and yet my 4(!) most recent 60HH reduced cup plunges have those side dents. And you describe it exactly right, they don't go away with loosening unless there's no tension at all. Normal wear even with the straps as loose as possible doesn't fix it. I probably keep my straps looser than ideal to try to mitigate it and that's annoying.

I have a fit photo somewhere of my new Florence plunge where I drop the strap off my shoulder and just gently lift the cup up as if it were containing my boob and *still* there's that weird indent. First I thought it indicated a cup that was too big, but Florence is at least a cup too small on my larger side and I quad out of it and still, dents in my boob. I have been putting it down to my boob tissue being too soft to offer any resistance. I wrote to Anna about it in exasperation, but she was on summer vacation and I never heard back. I've been a little behind and I need to follow up with her. 

I agree with the widening and minimizing appearance. I don't know if it's just Victoria in the 3HC, but my 65HH was the closest to fitting and it did the same, as did the 65J. TBH, I want to try an Ewa CHP because I think it would give more of the shape I prefer, except I may be too FoB for those now. Even my Freya half cups definitely minimize me less and that's saying something.

Regarding the band, I ordered the 70HH after the 65HH had a band that barely stretched past 25"". I wrote to Anna/Joanna at Comexim and explained that I had (at the time) a 27"" ribcage so *the 65 should work, but it is so tight and is that normal*? Joanna suggested the 70HH and I listened, but that band ran much bigger (i.e. more TTS). So I went back for a 65J. And yes, the band was finally right! But the 65J had a different cup shape entirely - it was taller and more open on top and gaped more, while the 70HH tapers nicely to the bust on top.  Comparison: [1](https://letstalkbras.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/comexim-victoria-comparison-65j-70hh-front.jpg), [2](https://letstalkbras.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/comexim-victoria-comparison-65j-70hh-front.jpg).

I've come to terms with the fact that I'd rather a tight band than a loose band from Comexim so I keep ordering 60s and what I get is always a surprise - somewhere along the continuum of ""perfectly comfortable"" to ""I need two extenders to breath"". I still love Comexim and I try to make peace with the margin of error in handmade goods. Perhaps each of my Victoria's was made by someone else, hence the wide variations?

If you have the patience and money, of course try for a 65J, or maybe even 2 with different alteration combinations. I just went for a 65J with the same alterations and I got pouchier side dents and cups that gaped in a weird way. But the gore was overlapping, lol.

I moved on to Victoria plunges next and finally got a great fit. I think I ordered 7 or 8 Victorias in total, including a bonus 2HC, which made no sense by fitting better than the 3HC which was too shallow for me. Perhaps I'm just cursed - everything seems to happen the opposite way to the norm with me when I order from Comexim.

FYI every fit characteristic you describe for yourself in terms of shape, soft tissue, etc, is exactly the same as me. I'm especially happy that Victoria fits you and it makes me want to try a 3HC in my new size. Glutton for punishment...

But I am moderately certain that no matter how much he is informed, he simply wouldn't care. 

That is my biggest gripe with Trump. He is a petty apathetic narcissist. He looks at things happening around him and concludes ""acting in this situation cannot benefit me so why should I give a fuck?"" The information that Puerto Ricans are US citizens means nothing to him because it would mean it would be his duty to take some level of responsibility and action, which he does not want to do. I assume he is aware that even before this natural disaster he was not particularly popular in Puerto Rico. So now this is his ""revenge"" - ""oh, you didn't like my Facebook post or retweet my tweet? Then I will not let you have any of the food I brought for the whole class.""

You're exactly right. What Trump does is irrelevant, it isn't the president that fixes these problems, it's the bureaus and organizations. This argument that Trump has blood on his hands because he isn't wasting time working a pity campaign is ridiculous. A presidents job is to sit at his desk and authorize or deny the papers that come his way, that's it. Obama turned it into a glorified celebrity spot as he went around making talk show appearances, and then people are shocked that a dipshit reality TV star is elected. This is a beast entirely of Obamas own making, and it's clear that the rest of country has bought into the celebrity president nonsense when they critique a guy for not being saccharine enough even while he does his job just fine."

0	WikiTextBot				"**Inquisitorial system**

An inquisitorial system is a legal system where the court or a part of the court is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, as opposed to an adversarial system where the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecution and the defense. Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with civil legal systems as opposed to common law systems. Countries using common law, including the United States, may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of misdemeanors such as minor traffic violations. The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common law system.

Yeah players have to perform, but it's the managers literal job to put the players that give his team the best chance to win out on the field. Joe just hasn't always done that consistently.

Would you be saying that it's up to ""the players not executing"" when you have a franchise so badly run as the #LolPadres, or the Fish, the Mets, or any other number of shit teams? 

What if Cash &amp; Girardi decided we're gonna field a Low A Ball team out there next year? Do the players really need to perform or is the management failing at their jobs?


Lastly I'm not assuming that a different move would have definitively worked every single time, I literally said that if a different move worked even 25% of the time we'd be in the ALDS already.  (and that's being generous! 10% would probably have us in the DS)

Do you think Girardi gave us the best chance to win when he got Holder to relieve Gray on Thursday night? All because he didn't want Khanle to get 4 outs instead of 3? Sure Holder ideally doesn't suck a chode in that situation, but putting him in that situation instead of almost anyone else in the pen is basically 100% never even close to being ""the right move"". For all we know Khanle goes out and sucks even worse, but it's unquestionably the obviously better decision to make in the moment!"

0	xachariah				"I think you can make 4 balanced teams with a single core box (although you'll be missing out on command cards).

[Imperial Army](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/061a191f7b21000000000000000000) - AT-ST, eOfficer, eProbe, Stormtroopers, and eStormtroopers.  The AT-ST can synergize with the eOfficer, but the list should be a relatively straightforward shooty army.

[Lord Vader's Command](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/131a1a7d2200000000000000000000) - Vader, 2xOfficer, eRoyal Guard, and Stormtroopers.  A nice melee focused list to play opposite of the shooty ones.  Has a little skill cap with officers and eRoyal Guard adjacency.  

[Scum trandocats](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/642c1e1d2423000000000000000000) - IG88(token), Nexu, eNexu, Trandoshans, eTrandoshans. Even using a token for IG88, this is literally the only way to get 40 pts for scum without temp alliance. 

[Rebels](http://tabletopadmiral.com/imperialassault/05021b011c66400000000000000000) - Han, Luke, Jyn, Gideon, Mak, rSabs, and High Command.  May be a little technical to play well, but it has great offense in dual 3-dice attacks + focus.  Normally I'd consider it weak, but since it has great access to stun it should fare fine vs Vader/IG88/AT-ST.

For balance, I think all 4 are relatively even.  With a veteran group I'd say that the Imperial Army or Rebels takes it no question, but I assume you're running with people unfamiliar with the game.  In that case, high likelyhood Vader just runs up and stabs everyone to death or the trandocats run the board with their close range attacks."

0	mcvey				"Drone strikes are way up under Trump.
&gt; A new report by the Columbia Law School Human Rights Clinic and the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies found that since President Donald Trump took office, the monthly rate of U.S. drone strikes has increased by almost four times former President Barack Obama’s average.

https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Monthly-US-Drone-Strikes-Quadrupled-Under-Trump-Report-20170613-0034.html

&gt; Since the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, drone strikes have increased over 400 percent.

&gt; As reported by Micah Zenko:

&gt;During President Obama’s two terms in office, he approved 542 such targeted strikes in 2,920 days — one every 5.4 days. From his inauguration through today, President Trump had approved at least 36 drone strikes or raids in 45 days — one every 1.25 days.

&gt;Do the maudlin math: despite his promises to reduce American intervention in foreign affairs and despite his oath to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,” under President Trump, these deadly drone strikes have increased 432 percent over the reprehensible pace set by his predecessor.

&gt;It’s not just the drones, though. President Trump is unhinged in his unleashing of U.S. airstrikes on “enemy” targets.

https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/foreign-policy/item/25604-drone-strikes-up-432-percent-under-donald-trump

Zenkos report: https://www.cfr.org/blog/not-so-peaceful-transition-power-trumps-drone-strikes-outpace-obama

&gt; Now, the Trump administration is contemplating additional policy changes that will further expand the CIA's authority to conduct drone strikes in a number of countries, both in and out of war zones. Such a move would reverse years of effort by President Barack Obama to reduce the CIA's role in targeted killing and shift that responsibility to the military. It could also mean more civilian casualties in CIA drone strikes.

Your intentions don't really matter all that much. If you've stepped on some toes, you apologize and try to move on.


And one person's ""organizing"" is another person's ""moving all my shit around so I can't find anything!"" so that's generally never cool unless the person is tremendously laid back. I am a middle-aged woman and when my mother visits, she will do laundry and fold my underwear! The first time this happened, I opened my sock drawer and thought ""wooo! the laundry fairies DO exist!"" then remembered my mama was visiting and she had folded my underwear and put it away in the wrong place. I didn't say anything because it wasn't a big deal to me BUT she is MY mother. If someone else's mother had done that, I'd be freaked and maybe a little pissed.


And you're a slight asshole for judging DIL's choices that differ from yours. While you say you accepted her decisions around having a doula and not wanting everyone around while she shoved a baby out of her skiddlyboop, your post SCREAMS judgment so I gotta think anyone with a scintilla of emotional awareness is going to know you were judging her.

Anyway, I think you should clarify something important. When do you believe a fetus is old enough such that it is now immoral to kill? We can surely all agree masturbation is not genocide. What about when the sperm first hits the egg? What about when the egg implants? I'm pretty sure all of us would have an easier time addressing your post if you clarified this.

Do you believe that life begins at conception?

I was lucky enough to have a baby who has slept solid nights since 3 months. But if she was still getting up in the night you'd bet your ass my husband would be helping in the evenings after work so I could get some rest.   It is not always possible to nap while the child naps, some kids just don't nap longer than 45 minutes, sometimes you have housework, sometimes you need to shower and eat and do other things that make you feel normal.  I understand letting the working parent get a decent nights sleep but one person should not be powering through sleep deprivation while the other relaxes on the couch.

A pause changed the pacing of the game. A single fan conveyed just enough information in a yell to the stage that a play was cancelled last minute. Something just *felt* wrong.


Something my friend always says to me is, the Superbowl is a single game for two reasons: (1) the players can barely handle a game a week, they couldnt do a BoAnything more than 1 and (2) it isn't about finding the best team, it's about putting on the best show. And sometimes, the best show is a complete upset.

However, the definition of premises is ""a house or building, together with its land and outbuildings"".

Leaving that by virtue of the definition, as I have stated, is seen by the American family courts, as abandonment. ""How could you leave your children in the care of her if she was so abusive!?"" is the argument. 

&gt;And your version of your wife hitting you repeatedly is rather calm. Have you ever been in a fist fight? I’ve not been in many, nor am I claiming to be a badass, but I can assure you that good choices and logic have very little to do with an actual fist fight.

I have been in many fist fights, I am a former Marine, I have had to literally fight for my life, and it is precisely during a fight when losing control of your faculties or going purely on emotion will get you killed. 

Shake, cry, scream, flail, do what you need to after the fight is over. During the fight, you either calculate and keep your head, or you lose the fight before it starts. 

&gt;Come on, I’m being civil.

I appreciate that. 

&gt;Admit that you read into it for the sake of having an argument, please.

There will be 1 cop in there just to make sure nothing bad goes down and 1-2 secretaries to help with paperwork. The first court date is almost certainly just a plea hearing. It gives you the opportunity to say whether you believe you are guilty or innocent. 

&amp;nbsp;

Show up to court a little bit early (20-30 minutes) and there should be somewhere for you to talk to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will be able to work with you. They may work out a deal where you plead guilty and do probation. They may work out that you pay a fine and the charges get dropped. It all depends. Again, no big deal. They deal with much worse crimes than petty theft. Just be honest with them, say you want to take care of your charges, that you'll never steal again, you learned your lesson, etc. They are humans just like you and are more than willing to help out. They would rather work with you and have much worse shit to deal with than petty theft. If you work something out with the prosecutor, when the judge calls you up, the prosecutor will tell the judge what you worked out, the judge will make sure you agree to it, and that's it. You won't spend more than 5 minutes standing in front of the judge. It's not some trial or anything.

Vordts hammer DOMINATES with its frost proc. I feel too strong using it. By using a hunters or knights ring you can effectively use many different weapons and not be limited.

0	UNOvven				"Once again, you are running into the same mistake. You assume that the mathematical average is the same as the actual outcome. I wouldnt notice that the deck was shuffled because I didnt see the decks order. But it would make a difference. To illustrate this ,take a regular deck of 52 playing cards, and put a straight as the top 5 cards. Then draw 5 cards. You may notice, you drew a straight. Now put them back on top, and shuffle them. Draw again. Most likely what you drew now is considerably worse. Now, imagine you were playing high-stakes poker, and bet good money on your hand. Would you still say that shuffling the deck made no difference?

Of course not. It made a noticable difference in that how the deck was made up before ,and how it was made up afterwards was different. The result you got, was different. The amount you won, or lost, was different. Everything changed. So if a card shuffles the deck, then yes it makes a huge impact.

But just to once again make clear why your logic is faulty at best, and absolute nonsense at worst, what you are saying is that every time someone won the lottery and got a few million dollars richer .... they actually didnt. Because those numbers couldve just been any other numbers. That is your logic, after all. Still stand by it?"

Ross' flaws are his injury history, and his height. I'm not saying he'll be a terrible player by any means (if he gets on the field), I'm just saying that his selection was A) too early, B) not the biggest need for the team, C) not BPA.

He could be the next Marvin Jones for us, but even then the pick was way too early.

And of course, he needs to get on the damn field. Top 10 picks are supposed to be immediate contributors.

When the Power company wants to put in new poles or go underground, they can't just move the telephone lines because they don't own them, so they'll often chop of the top of the old pole (the doublewood) until the phone company has the time to move over their lines. They might also might have their own poles if for some reason they don't want to pay the utility money, or if they want to go overhead but the power is underground 	True	0	1506816311		0	0	dnqirs5	False	t3_73fa93	t1_dnqfcw7	/r/OSHA/comments/73fa93/i_didnt_realize_yellow_police_tape_was_that_strong/dnqirs5/	1509189733	2	False	OSHA	t5_2y3wz

0	blue-cube				"I don't think it is was mostly ""National Socialist"" Sweeds (who, as per the article, had a permit to march even if they don't really have a Bill of Rights in Sweden -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Sweden) who were getting arrested.  Several articles refer to ""foreigners"" with getting arrested pre-event.  And there is the below from a Swedish paper. Although it looks like at least the head Neo-Nazi was arrested.



https://www.thelocal.se/20170930/gothenburg-neo-nazi-demonstration-ends-after-hours-of-unrest



&gt;The number of counter demonstrators far outweighed the amount of NMR supporters, and violent elements of these attacked police on several occasions, including by throwing stones, reports TT.
&gt;
Counter-protestors rushed at police near the Liseberg Amusement Park, with horses deployed to keep them under control. According to a statement on the police website, stones were thrown during that flashpoint with a number of people held by police near the main entrance to the amusement park.

&gt;“In connection with the disturbances at Liseberg, where we moved away counter-demonstrators, stones were thrown, resulting in injury to one civilian. The person was hit by an object and has been taken to hospital by ambulance,” police press spokesperson Peter Adlersson said.

&gt;A police officer was also taken to hospital with minor injuries earlier in the day.

&gt;NMR leader Simon Lindberg has been arrested on suspicion of assault, reports newspaper Expressen.

&gt;“Simon Lindberg participated at the beginning of the unrest and is suspected of violent unrest and assaulting a police officer,” police press spokesperson Hans Lippens told the newspaper.

&gt;Several people, including foreign citizens, were detained prior to the demonstration by police in Gothenburg and other parts of Sweden on suspicion of intending to carry out assault.

And it doesn't get breathy it gets scratchy, like when you have mucus on your chords. Hopefully it's not nodules.. I have had those before and I definitely don't want them again.

I'll try the adduction exercise though, thank you.
