The original comment and post files are on google drive because they are really big.
Put them all in the same directory and not that with the raw_data_location setting

Graphs are generated with the following names
<year>-<N><posts|comments>-<N><normalized>-<deconvolved>-<trolls>

<year>: the year of data. either 3 months from 2016 or 2 months from 2017

<N><posts|comments>: whether subreddits and user are connected by posts,
comments, or both, and how many (N) users in common are required for two subreddits to become
connected during folding

<N><normalized>: whether the number (N) of comments/posts was normalized by capping at a threshold

<deconvolved>: whether the graph is deconvolved

<trolls>: whether it's just trolls, no trolls, or everyone

with both a .txt extension and a .csv extension. the .txt is for SNAP, the .csv is for Gephi

all graphs use only the whitelisted subreddits
