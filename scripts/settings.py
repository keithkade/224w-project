How the flow works.

There are a number of steps to this process. The settings control things along the way.
The original comment, post, and author files are on google drive because they are really big.
They were generated with the 'trim_to_whitelist' scripts. Put them all in the same directory
and note that with the raw_data_location setting

To make a new graph

First run the cap_posts|comments scripts. That reads the raw comments and,
caps them according to any threshold, and generates comment, post, and author csvs. You
only need to run this step whenever you change the comments_cap, posts_cap, or year variables.
This takes a while (20-30 minutes), in particular the scanning of all the users and gathering their info.
There are over 66,100,000 users.

Then run build_bipartite_graph.py. It will generate edglist graph files in the format below:

---------------------------FILE FORMATS---------------------------

Graphs are generated with the following names
<year>-<N><posts|comments>-<N><CommentCap>-<N><PostCap>-<deconvolved>-<trolls>

<year>: the year of data. either 3 months from 2016 or 2 months from 2017

<N><posts|comments>: whether subreddits and user are connected by posts,
comments, or both, and how many (N) users in common are required for two subreddits to become
connected during folding

<N><CommentCapped>: the number of comments allowed per subreddit

<N><PostCapped>: the number of posts allowed per subreddit

<deconvolved>: whether the graph is deconvolved

<trolls>: whether it's just trolls, no trolls, or everyone

with both a .txt extension and a .csv extension. the .txt is for SNAP, the .csv is for Gephi

all graphs use only the whitelisted subreddits
